            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THO Custome hath in some sort made it necessary to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Reader with a <hi>Preface,</hi> before he enters upon the perusal of a Book; shewing the Designe, and the occasion of Writing of it; yet in this case I hope there will be no need, either to <hi>Court his Favour,</hi> or <hi>Mollifie his Displeasure,</hi> for undertaking the Defence of Christianity against the Great and dangerous opposers of it. For this being the Comon Cause in which every man who is called by the name of Christ, hath an Interest, he may I hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>begging pardon,</hi> or if he please without <hi>shewing any Reason,</hi> engage in maintenance of our Holy Religion, Embraced by the whole Church of God, as well as by that of which he is a Member; Against all such, who shall either openly oppose, or secretly endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine it.</p>
                  <p>Here every man is a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and by his <hi>Baptismal</hi> Vow, having bin listed under Christs Banner, is obliged to fight under it, against all the Enemies of his Saviour; and such are the <hi>pernicious Opinions</hi> here represented, which carry in their forehead an open, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hostility; and direct opposition to the Divinity, and the Crosse of Christ. The adversaries of our Holy Religion have taken the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to publish their Impious Opinions, not only <hi>without Leave,</hi> but in <hi>Opposition</hi> to the just Authority, and the known and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws of this Nation: they have revived the Opinions, reprinted the Books of some former Socinian Writers, which had almost bin
<pb facs="tcp:62459:3"/> forgotten, but they have taken care to refresh our memories; and all this hath bin done in defyance to the Govermennt, as well as in the Face of it.</p>
                  <p>It hath bin as the occasion of trouble to all <hi>Good men,</hi> so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise matter of Wonder and Enquiry to all <hi>Considering men,</hi> to find the Nation pesterd with such numbers of Socinian Books, which have swarm'd all upon a suddain, and have bin industriously dispersed thro' all parts of the Kingdom, whereby many weak and unstable Souls have bin beguiled, <hi>and their minds corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who they are, who have bin the secret abettors and promoters of these Antichristian Doctrines as it is variously discoursed, so I shall not Curiously Enquire; least by Roaving and uncertain Conjectures, the Innocent may be mistaken for the Criminals. Only this I think is so evident, that it may be taken for granted; That since there have bin no considerable numbers of men formerly, that we know of, who have <hi>openly and avowedly</hi> professed the Impious tenents of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin.</hi> They must have <hi>lain lurking</hi> under some other <hi>outward name and profession,</hi> watching the first and most convenient opportunity to divulge their Opinions, which for some just and weighty reasons no doubt, they thought fit for some time to stifle and conceal. I think there are scarce any among us so foolish as to imagine, that like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Off-Spring (tho' without doubt the Old Serpent hath had no small hand in this Affair) these men should spring out of the Ground; or as some have fancyed of Woodcocks, that they have dropped out of the <hi>Clouds among us:</hi> it is therefore beyond all doubt, that they have lain hid and disguised under the denomination of some other Sect or Party, and Profession.</p>
                  <p>But among other persons or parties concerned in this Affair, it would be a <hi>Miracle,</hi> greater then any of late years pretended to be wrought in France for the Conversion of the poor <hi>Hugonots</hi> there, if the Papists should not be engaged in it: who never as yet have stood by as <hi>unconcerned Spectators,</hi> when any mischeife was in contrivance against our Church: But have always watched, and laid hold on the fittest Opportunity, of Sowing and Increasing <hi>Divisions</hi> among us; and who have by a late Experiment sufficiently convinced the World, that they have a much better Knack, at <hi>Unsetling and
<pb facs="tcp:62459:3"/> Disturbing our Religion,</hi> then in <hi>Establishing and Defending thir own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No question it must afford matter of no small Sport and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them; to find a <hi>Generation of Men,</hi> or <hi>Vipers</hi> rather shall I call them, risen up in their stead, who may tho' by different methods, at length perfect that design which they have bin long since projecting, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ruine of this poor Church, and the destruction of that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Excellent Religion, which by Gods Right Hand hath bin Established, and hitherto wonderfully preserved among us.</p>
                  <p>But whatever <hi>the Causes</hi> have bin of this suddain Appearance of <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> or whoever were <hi>the Authors</hi> that have secretly and in masquerade, abetted and encouraged it; much of which lies as yet in the <hi>dark;</hi> the <hi>pernicious effects</hi> of it have bin, and are, at this day too <hi>Visible.</hi> The minds of men as we said before, throughout the Nation being strangely corrupted; <hi>Infidelity and Scepticism</hi> universally prevailing. Some deriding all Religion, which they either laugh at as the effect of <hi>Folly and Superstition,</hi> or detest as a meer <hi>Cheat and Contrivance</hi> of some Cunning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing men.</p>
                  <p>Others profess themselves Enemies to all Revealed Religion, speak opprobriously of the Holy Scriptures, deride the Sacred Pen-men of them, and make but a jest of any thing that is said in vindication of their Authority and Inspiration.</p>
                  <p>A Third sort seeme to owne, and profess to believe the Bible, yet oppose, nay not only so but <hi>Ridicule</hi> all the Great <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our Religion; such as are the Doctrins concerning the Blessed Trinity, the Incarnation of the Son of God, the Redemtion of the World by the Merit of his Death and Suffrings; the beleife of which have bin hitherto looked upon to be the Badge and Mark whereby Christians have bin distinguished from Jews and Mahometans.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, a Fourth sort there are (for you must know there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ranks and Orders of these Enemies of our Religion) who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Scriptures as we do, and Believe, at least they tell us they do so, all the Great Mysteries of our Faith contained there; but yet at the same time they take care to let us know, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of these <hi>is not necessary.</hi> So that whether you are a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever or an Infidel</hi> in these matters, it makes no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<pb facs="tcp:62459:4"/> forasmuch as the Honour of God, the Welfare of Religion, and the Salvation of your own Soul, is not concerned either one way or other. And if so I am sure no wise man ought to <hi>trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> much less to give others any Trouble about such <hi>Trifling and Inconsiderable Opinions.</hi> And these I look upon to be the greatest and most dangerous of all the forementioned Enemies, forasmuch as by the Observation of all Ages, it hath bin found a much surer and speedier way, to ruin any cause by <hi>betraying</hi> then <hi>opposing</hi> it; and that you may much easier guard your self from the <hi>Open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility</hi> of a professed Enemy, then from the <hi>Treachery and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> of a pretended Friend.</p>
                  <p>To prevent therefore if it be possible (and I hope it is not too late to Attempt it) the Growth and Progress <hi>of that Infidelity</hi> which is to be found in many; That <hi>Coldness and Indifference</hi> about the Great and Sacred Mysteries of our Religion, which is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in others; All which are the blessed effects of Socinianisme; and which seem to have diffused themselves among all <hi>Orders and Ranks</hi> of men among us, beyond the <hi>Example of former times;</hi> It hath bin Judged an advizable course, to shew the plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect opposition, that is between the <hi>Doctrins of Socinus</hi> and those which are revealed by the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in the Holy Scriptures, and especially in the Writings of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And this, among such especially who have not extinguished all Regard for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may, as it is hoped, be of some good vse, to fortifye them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Infection</hi> of these pernicious Errors, which have already spread <hi>like a Gangrene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Writers generally have bin Employed, and that very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably, and for the most part with great success; in vindicating our Holy Religion, from the Bold and Impudent Cavils of these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; and so have stood upon the <hi>Defensive part.</hi> Now it may be thought, for many good Reasons, advisable, to make <hi>an Offensive War</hi> upon these <hi>Infidels;</hi> and to bring it into their own Territories. That is, that the charge of Ʋnreasonableness and Impiety, which they with <hi>Equal Falshood and Impudence,</hi> have laid at the Door of the Christian Religion; should be retorted upon their New, and Dangerous Opinions; which upon Examination will be found to be <hi>Opposite to Piety, Repugnant to plain Reason,</hi> and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb facs="tcp:62459:4"/> such as will conduce to the <hi>Overthrow of all true Religion.</hi> And to discover this, (which I hope in some measure is done in them) is the design of these following Papers; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Religion of <hi>Socinus</hi> as opposed to Christianity is both <hi>Impious and Absurd.</hi> So that fairly to <hi>represent</hi> Socinianisme will be the best method that we can take to <hi>Confute it;</hi> and rightly to state the Controversy, will be the speediest way to put an end to it.</p>
                  <p>I confess as to the point of Reason, the <hi>Socinians</hi> have laid such a claim to it, as if they did intend to <hi>Engross and Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize</hi> that to themselves, which yet, tho' in several degrees, is the <hi>Right and Inheritance</hi> of all mankind. And for their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this, they have so magnified themselves, and have bin so undecently as well as unjustly magnifyed by others; that many inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and well meaning men have bin affraid to enter the Lists with these <hi>Sons of Anak,</hi> these <hi>Champions of Infidelity.</hi> But I dare venture to assure the Reader, he needs not fear to encounter these Gyants upon the <hi>plain square of Reason,</hi> notwithstanding all their Boasts and Brags of it. And I think it may be easily made out, that in Opposition to some Important Articles of our Faith, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Repugnance to Reason, they have advanced some other positions, so contrary to Reason; that when they come to be compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I believe it will be found, that there is scarce any thing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, not excepting that <hi>Gross, Fulsome Doctrin of Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;</hi> which contains <hi>greater Absurdities,</hi> more opposite to, and incomprehensible by natural Reason. Particularly what they say con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Factitious Divinity of Christ,</hi> is by far more uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable then what the Papists aver of the change of the Elements in the Eucharist. And any man that hath abilities to judge of these matters, will upon enquiry find; that it is less Absurd and Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, if there are Degrees of Absurdity in Contradictions, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in things that are Impossible; that a peece of Bread should be <hi>Transubstantiated into Flesh,</hi> then that a man should be <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into a God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short tho Reason be the Idol of these men yet I must desire to be excused if I do not stand in any great awe and admiration of it: and truly for my own part, I should much rather fear the <hi>Malice</hi> then the <hi>Reason</hi> of a Socinian, at any time. And I am
<pb facs="tcp:62459:5"/> affraid, that if ever these men (Quod avertat Deus) should gain <hi>strength and numbers</hi> among us; they would prove one of the most <hi>Cruel and Sanguinary</hi> Sects, that ever yet disturbed the peace of the Church. It is not to be denied, but that they have in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings advanced some parts of Christian Morality to a great height, and have spoke many and deservedly great things, concerning forgiveness of injuries and patience under them, in Complyance with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and in Imitation of the Example of our Blessed Saviour: But I should be loath to trust a <hi>Socinian</hi> for all that; and if we were forced to make the Tryal (tho I hope we are in no danger of the experiment) I doubt not but we should find, <hi>the forgiveness</hi> of these Men more Implacable then the <hi>Revenge of others:</hi> and that their <hi>meekness and moderation</hi> would have more terrible effects, then the <hi>rage and fury</hi> of the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> in ancient times. And that the Reader may not think I utter this without ground, tho I have a <hi>great many,</hi> I will at present offer but <hi>one reason</hi> for my conjecture, and that is taken from their <hi>Boysterous, Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Scurrilous</hi> way of treating the great and adorable mysteries of our Religion; which shews what usage the <hi>professors of them</hi> would in all likelyhood meet, if they ever had them in their power.</p>
                  <p>The Blessed Trinity is by some of them styled <hi>Triceps Cerberus,</hi> and the doctrine concerning it they have ascribed to the <hi>Invention of the Devil,</hi> and tell us that it was fetched from <hi>Hell.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will speak very honorably of our Saviour, but at other times, and upon other occasions so reproachfully of his divine nature, that they treat him worse then either the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and Crucified him. And tho they pay <hi>divine Honour and Adoration</hi> to him, yet that doth not take of the guilt and impiety of their <hi>Sacrilegious denyal,</hi> and as far as in them lies <hi>Despoiling him of his Divinity;</hi> but herein they transcribe the Copy which the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers before mentioend, set them after his Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by <hi>Pilate;</hi> who put a Crown upon his head, and a Scepter into his hand? and yet at the same time they Spit in his Face and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted him.</p>
                  <p>One would think that the <hi>great and venerable mysteries</hi> of our Religion, entertained by all the Wisest, and Learnedst, and best Men and Churches, in all ages ever since Christianity was first planted in
<pb facs="tcp:62459:5"/> the World; tho they had bin Errors, yet had deserved to be treated with a little more <hi>Civility and Respect,</hi> then these men have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Writings: who have wanted something else besides a good Cause to defend: for they have wanted Modesty and Civility in the Defence of a very bad one; have wanted the Candor and Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of a fair adversary; and have treated the mysteries of our Faith with such a <hi>Prostitute,</hi> and <hi>Impudent Scurrility;</hi> that we cannot well tell what reply to make to them; except in Imitation of the blessed and meek Arch-Angel <hi>Michael,</hi> we should desire God to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in his own quarrel, and to rebuke the <hi>Blasphemies of these men,</hi> But to have mercy upon the <hi>Blasphemers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Conclude all, as there is no danger at present, God be thanked, that we should be <hi>frighted</hi> out of our Religion, so I hope we shall not be <hi>wheedled</hi> out of it, by <hi>any of the Artifices</hi> of these seducers who lye in wait to deceive; nor by any other <hi>specious pretenses</hi> that they may make; no not by the <hi>pretense of Peace,</hi> which I know hath sometimes bin offered in their behalfe. I confess peace is a most desireable thing, the blessings that attend it are <hi>so great</hi> that we cannot tell how sufficiently <hi>to value,</hi> and <hi>so many,</hi> that we can scarce <hi>number them.</hi> So that all <hi>humble and truely pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> should be content to part with any thing to obtein it.</p>
                  <p>But I must recal that last word, for upon <hi>second thoughts</hi> I find it may be too <hi>dearly purchased;</hi> as it certainly will be, when bought at the expense either of <hi>Truth or Justice;</hi> without which, <hi>Peace</hi> tho otherwise the most useful and excellent, would prove one the most pernicious and mischievous things in the World. And when I speak of Truth I chiefly and principaly mean those fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truths which are treated of in these following Papers, the Belief of which have hitherto bin looked upon by most Christians, to be <hi>necessary to our Salvation:</hi> and if there be any Truths of that Importance I hope every man will consider, that tho Peace be much to be desired, yet that it is not advisable for him to hazard his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to secure it.</p>
                  <p>When all is done the reputation of being esteemed a <hi>Peaceable and moderate man</hi> will stand a man but in little stead when he comes to appear before the Tribunal of Christ, and there to be charged with the guilt of betraying his Religion, and at the same time, the Souls
<pb facs="tcp:62459:6"/> of them committed to his charge, to endless perdition and ruin. In one word, tho Peace be so great a blessing that a man might be content to lay down his Life, yet no man should lay down his Soul for the sake of it. And tho a <hi>Pious man</hi> might in some cases commendably sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>to Death,</hi> yet no <hi>wise man,</hi> nay indeed no man not out of his wits, would <hi>venture upon damnation to Obtain it.</hi>

                  <head>A PRESERVATIVE AGAINST <hi>Socinianism.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN all ages ever since the first planting of a Christian Church in the world, God for many wise reasons hath thought fit to exercise it with various and different sorts of tryals. The Apostles who were immediately commissioned by Christ, and sent to teach all Nations, and thereby to bring them over to the belief and obedience of the Gospel, according to the prediction of their blessed Master in the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> who had forewarned them of it, met with great and violent opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that both from <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> who with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary zeal or rather fury, set themselves to oppress and stifle this new doctrine, if it were possible at its first appearance, and before it had gained much ground and footing in the world.</p>
                  <p>But besides the open force with which the enemies of it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to destroy the Christian doctrine, the Apostles and other Ministers of it, met with another and more dangerous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position from some false brethren, who did not ayme so much at the destruction of the Christian faith, as by some undue mixtures to corrupt the purity of it. Such were the Judaizing Christians, who tho they embraced the doctrine of the Gospel, yet still they retain'd a weighty affection for their old Religion and the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> to the observance of which they thought themselves under an indispensable obligation, and not only so,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62459:7"/> but would oblige all other Converts to the like observance; and their zeal in this matter occasioned no small trouble to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stles, and disturbance to the Churches, where they first planted the Christian faith, see <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> And tho this was a matter of no small concern, and might in the conclusion have proved of dangerous consequence, yet it was not considerable in a manner, if compared with many other execrable opinions and practices, which began very early to be introduced into the Church, by <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus, Menander, Saturninus, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silides</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates.</hi> Succeeded afterwards by <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Marcus, Marcion,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> and a long train of <hi>Hereticks</hi> shall I call them? or <hi>Hobgoblins;</hi> for so I think they might well be styled, if we consider either the darkness and ignorance of all religious matters with which they were encompassed, or the wild pranks which they played, to the great disturbance of all good men; who were all descended from that son of perdition <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who was their Patriarch and Ring-leader. It were a difficult task to muster up the names, but allmost an endless attempt to reckon the senseless and extravagant opinions of these <hi>Hereticks;</hi> by reason of whose pernicious ways, the way of truth was evil spoken of. For many of the objections of the Heathens against Christianity, tho all of them were false, yet many of them were taken from the execrable opinions and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of these lewd miscreants, who thereby brought no small disgrace upon the Christian Religion, and put no small stop to the growth and propagation of it. But not to prosecute this matter any farther, if we descend a little lower, we shall find that God had no sooner dissipated the storm that hung over the Christian Church for some Centuries; and put a stop to the effusion of any more of that blood, which without any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Age or Sex, was spilt like water under the ten famous persecutions by the advancement of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Empire; but the devil betakes himself to new shifts: who finding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer methods of cruelty so signally baffled by the patience and constancy of the Martyrs, he begins to play a new, or rather to revive his old game, and since he cannot destroy the professors of Christianity, he will endeavour to undermine their Religion:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62459:7"/> he had indeed made a vigorous effort, to extinguinsh both the name and memory of the Christian Religion, and to have tore up both the faith and the believers quite by the very roots; but herein he was disappointed, and therefore he endeavours to compass that by stratagem, which he cannot effect by storm; and in this method he finds greater success then in the former; for being baffled as we said before, in his attempts upon the disciples of Christ, he attacks the doctrine which they embraced: and here <hi>Inimicus homo,</hi> the enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat; hoping thereby to choke the word, which now he dispair'd to extirpate. And herein he found fit instruments for the execution of his design, for taking advantage of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and curiosity, the discontent and revenge, and other disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly passions of <hi>Arius, Photinus, Nestorius, Eutyches</hi> and others, he soon prevail'd with them to assist him in the project which he had layd, for corrupting the doctrine and thereby disturbing the peace of the Church. For they presently broached many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opinions, whereby they did either plainly deny, or some other way pervert the doctrines then generally entertained by the whole Church, concerning the natures and the person of the son of God.</p>
                  <p>But these errors having long since bin buried in the western Church, and lay forgotten in a manner with their Authors, were again unhappily revived at the beginning of the Reformation, by the endeavors chiefly of some Polanders and Italians in the last age, and among them principally of <hi>Faustus Socinus;</hi> who having gathered up the dangerous errors of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> chiefly, against the divinity of Christ, he put them together in one body, together with those of <hi>Pelagius</hi> in the point of original sin, and those other doctrines which are supposed to have a necessary dependance upon it.</p>
                  <p>And herein <hi>Socinus</hi> seems chiefly to have chosen <hi>Pelagius</hi> for his pattern. For the other Hereticks, I mean <hi>Arius, Photinus,</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi> being content with the denyal of those fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doctrines, concerning the divinity of the Son and the Holy Ghost, or with their perticular Errors about the natures and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Christ, as <hi>Nestorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches;</hi> they did not attend to,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62459:8"/> or at least did not draw out those doctrines into all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious consequences, which might when clearly understood, overthrow all the other parts of the Christian doctrine. But <hi>Pelagius</hi> gave us a systeme of his Divinity, and drew out his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors into a greater length, in opposition to several important parts and branches of our Religion; chiefly that which concerned the doctrine of Original Sin, which naturally lead him into those other dangerous mistakes, which did by consequence overthrow the necessity of the satisfaction made by Christ, and the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world by the merit of his death and sufferings, as the Fathers, and particularly St. <hi>Austin</hi> directly charge him. For he was master of reason enough to consider where it was that his first Error would naturally lead him, and he was content to follow it, and thereby fell into that Labyrinth of errors, from which with all his skill and sophistry he could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle himself; for when pressed with the arguments of his adversaries, and the authority and tradition of the Catholick Church; tho he could and did find as many shifts and tricks as any other, to escape the force and conviction of truth; yet his former and fundamental error in denying the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and the original guilt and stayn of our natures contracted thereby, hung like a dead weight about him, and sunk him down into those impious opinions which he broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the grace of God, and the liberty and freedom of mans will in religious matters in opposition to that Grace. Concerning the nature and efficacy of the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the merit of good works and the justification of a sinner, the nature of Gods law and the possibility of arising to a state of perfection in this life, by yielding a perfect obedience to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which having been picked up by <hi>Socinus,</hi> together with what was deliver'd by the other Hereticks, against the divinity of the son of God, and the Holy Ghost, he hath at length given us the most perfect systeme of Heresies, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the doctrine of the Gospel, in allmost all the parts and branches of it, that ever was ushered into the world. And indeed to give him his due, tho in point of time and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was inferior, yet in point of skill and management, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62459:8"/> is, in the art of Heresy, he was superior to all that went before him, most of whom were but fools and bunglers in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For many of the ancient Hereticks, had several extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and incohaerent notions, which had no more connexion between one another, then the parts of a rope of sand: soe that like a company of mad and hair-brained people, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the Christian Religion with great fury, but it was at randome and without skill; flinging about their mad opinions like wild-fire, with which indeed they did a great deal of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, but it was at all adventures, without order, and as one would imagine, without any certain aime. But <hi>Socinus</hi> comes more gravely and leasurely to work, and what <hi>M. Cato</hi> said in another case of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> * may be applyed to him, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius accessit ad perdendam religionem.</hi> Like a man that had his wits, tho, as many think, not the fear of God about him, he comes more soberly and with greater deliberation to destroy the Christian Religion: be puts his opinions into better order, his errors are better united, and have as far as the nature of error would allow, for the most part a good correspondence between one another: like a wary and well disciplined Captain, he puts his arguments into good array, levels his batteries against the great mysteries of our Religion, and chiefly against the eternal Divinity of the son of God: as well knowing that if he can suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his attempt upon that, he may promise himself an easy and cheap victory over all the rest of our Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having, as he thinks, effectually overthrown that main and fundamental article of it concerning the ever blessed Trinity; he is resolved to follow his blow, and to pursue his imaginary conquest in that point, to the overthrow of all the other parts of the Christian doctrine: he saw where <hi>Arius, Photinus, Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, &amp;c.</hi> were wanting, who having, as was said before, contented themselves with their particular errors concerning the natures and person of Christ, as persons who thought they had done mischief enough, they seemed content with what they had done, and went no farther. But <hi>Socinus</hi> in imitation of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved<note place="bottom">

                     <hi>Pelagius,</hi> enlarged our prospect into his Religion, and from the principles which he laid down, he drew out his conclusions to a greater length: for having denyed the Trinity, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the eternal divinity of our Savior, with it he could not avoid denying his satisfaction, and the redemption of the world by the merit of his death and sufferings; having disowned the personality of the Holy Ghost, the necessity of his grace, and the efficacy of his operations upon the minds of men, must at the same time fall to the ground. Together with these he hath published many dangerous errors concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and attributes of God, concerning his prescience and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the government of the world, concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man and the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that corruption of our natures which is the consequence of it, concerning justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith which is the means of obtaining it. Concerning the Church, its nature and the notes whereby it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from all other societies, concerning the ministry and the persons to whom Christ hath committed the care and government of his Church; their distinction and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to preach the Gospel, and to exercise discipline in it. Concerning the Sacraments and the end of their institution, and particularly concerning the nature and efficacy of Baptism and the Lords Supper. Lastly concerning a future state and the condition of men after this Life. To which may be added some other doctrines, which doe not seeme to have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the former, but yet are of dangerous consequence to the peace and wellfare of all civil societies: those I mean which he hath advanced about the power and authority of the Civil Magistrate, the Lawfullness of war and oaths in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Commonwealth, which have as mischievous an influence upon the order and peace of States and Kingdomes, as his other opinions have upon Religion.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Socinus</hi> having observed what was wanting in the former Hereticks to make their attempts entirely successful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Christian Religion; being engaged in the same design, but in order to make it more effectual, he wisely resolved to correct what he thought was amiss in them: wherefore lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62459:9"/> aside what was more gross and absurd in the wilder and more extravagant opinions of the ancient Hereticks, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the defects of the more subtile and refined who came afterwards; he and his followers have at length given us a body of their divinity, more compleat in its kind then ever the world was blessed with before their time. Not but that in spight of all their art and skill, such being the fate and folly of error, they cannot avoid, especially in the defence and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their opinions, falling into many and those very plain contradictions. Upon the whole matter I think it may be reasonably doubted whether <hi>Socinus,</hi> any more then that grand Impostor <hi>Mahomet,</hi> may be properly called a Heretick, as being the Founder of a new Religion, rather then the Author of a new name and sect among Christians. For as the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran of the former, is, as we are told, a fardel of errors and absurdities arising from the impure mixture of Christianity, <hi>Judaism</hi> and <hi>Paganism,</hi> together with some idle and extravagant notions of his own; so the doctrine of <hi>Socinus,</hi> seems to be a composition of the errors of <hi>Arius, Photinus,</hi> and <hi>Pelagius, &amp;c.</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some additions of his own, not indeed so seemingly absurd, as those of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but I am afraid no less dangerous to the Christian religion; of which he hath retained only the name together with the empty sound of the words; but with such false glosses, such forced and malicious interpretations, as have quite destroyed the true notion, as the whole design of the Gospel: in opposition to which he hath given us a kind of natural and new religion, not such as the spirit of God hath revealed in his word, but such as his own carnal reason suggested to him, in opposition to that revelation. And that this may not be looked upon to be an uncharitable because a groundless charge; I shall lay before the reader a scheme of the religion revealed by God in Holy Scripture, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that published by Christ and his Apostles in the writings of the New Testament, and which hath bin embraced by all sound Christians in all ages of the Church, from the first plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one in the world, to this day: Together with another of the new, or newly revived opinions of the Socinians: that by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62459:10"/> comparing of both, he may be able to make a judgment of what is here suggested, which upon examination I hope he will find to be agreeable to truth, and not contrary to charity. And first as it is fit, we shall begin with the great object of our religion, Allmighty God: in the knowledge and worship of whom, together with an obedience to his commands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the entire nature of religion. And here upon enquiry I believe we shall find, that what the Scriptures have revealed concerning the nature of God, is widely different from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Socinus</hi> and his disciples give us of him.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns the nature of God, the Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be considered two ways by us., 1. Absolutely in his glorious and essential attributes, or <hi>2ly,</hi> Relatively in the great and adorable mystery of the ever blessed Trinity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> if we consider God in his Attributes, we shall find that the first great, and if I may so call it, fundamental attribute which the Scriptures reveal, and indeed natural reason dictates concerning him, is the unity of the Godhead, Deut. 6. 4. <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord.</hi> Deut. 32. 39. <hi>See now that I, even I am be, and there is no God with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 5. 6. <hi>For tho there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father of whom are all things.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5. <hi>There is but one God, and one Mediator between God and man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Here undoubtedly it will be said that the Socinians are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all suspition orthodox, all their studies and labors being employed in asserting and vindicating the unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in opposition to the doctrine of the Trinity, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their apprehensions must infer a plurality of Gods. But for all their boasts concerning this matter, and assuming to themselves upon that score the name of Unitarians, we must not be too hasty in acquitting them from the imputation of Polytheism; for tho they deny the eternal generation and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, and say that he had no existence before his being formed in the wombe of the Virgin, and appearance in the world; and that the being which he then had was purely humane: yet after his resurrection from the grave, and his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62459:10"/> ascension into heaven, they say that God the father as the reward of his obedience and sufferings, exalted him to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity of a God; not indeed to be the supreme and eternal God, but however <hi>deus verus,</hi> a true God, distinct and separate from his Father; and <hi>Socinus</hi> takes it ill of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, that they should charge him with denying Christ to be God <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quasi nos Christum verum deum esse negamus, quod tamen à nobis non sit,</hi> Socin. oper. Tom. 2. p. 645.</note>, and complains against them that will not be brought to confess and worship him <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ut pro Deo ac Domino suo venerentur,</hi> p. 631.</note>, for their Lord and God, who was once a weak and infirm man: and herein he saith the power and goodness of God was discovered, and his admirable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom displayed, in extolling and deifying this man, beyond what we can imagin <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In eo homine supra quam dici potest extollendo &amp; deificando,</hi> Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And to the objection that might be made against this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as that which did unavoidably infer a plurality of Gods, <hi>Wolzogenius</hi> will tell you, that if by two Gods you mean one of whom are all things and we in him, and one by whom are all things and we by him, we are so far saith he, from being ashamed of worshiping two such Gods, that we rather glory in it <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ut potius id gloriae nobis &amp; laudi ducamus,</hi> Wolzogen. Prolegom. in Evangel. Johannis cap. 8. <hi>de vera divinitate Christi.</hi>
                     </note>. But if it shall be farther said, that to do them right, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but one supreme God by nature, and that Christ is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a God by Appointment and Office, not, <hi>natus</hi> but <hi>factus,</hi> not born but made, and deifyed after his ascension, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the divine power, wisdom and goodness to him.</p>
                  <p>I Ans. that this is so far from abating, that it rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases the difficulty, and makes the <hi>Socinian</hi> notion both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and impious, as may be shewn more at large hereafter, when we come to lay the charge of Idolatry at their door. Indeed one would think it should be a debasing of the name and honour that is due to God, to give either of them to any but him that is so from all eternity; the same <hi>Wolzogen.</hi> will tell you, you may if you please, reproach them for so doing, but he values it not a rush, <hi>nos non erubescimus,</hi> we are not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62459:11"/> ashamed to own that we worship <hi>deum factum vel factitium,</hi> a made God; not made indeed by a Goldsmith or Ingraver, <hi>ab aliquo sculptore vel aurifabro,</hi> but they acknowledge with St. <hi>Peter</hi> Acts 2. 36. <hi>that God hath made Jesus who was crucifyed Lord and Christ,</hi> that is, saith he, <hi>deum eximium fecerit,</hi> hath made him a great and eminent God. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be not enough, if you please to consult <hi>Smalcius,</hi> he will give you all the satisfaction that you can possibly desire further in this matter. For first, he will tell you, that whereas the Scriptures assure us that there is but one only true God, yet that must be taken <hi>sano sensu;</hi> not as if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true God besides God the Father, but that there is none that is God; <hi>eodem prorsus modo,</hi> just in the same manner as he is <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quod vero Deus ille unus qui pater est, solus verus dicitur, id non ideo fieri di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus quod nemo alius praeter Patrem deus verus sit, sed quia nemo alius praeter Patrem, isto prorsus modo deus verus sit, quo ille est.</hi> Smal.

For otherwise the thing is certain and past all doubt, that there are more true Gods then one; and let the Inspired writers be never so positive, yet he and his friends can and will with equal confidence advance this contrary position, that the true God is not only God <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>And indeed they have reason to contend earnestly for this opinion, if it be true what he saith in the same place, that to acknowledge and confess, and adore one only chief and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, is purely <hi>judaical,</hi> and a <hi>renunciation of the Christian Religion</hi>

Here he speaks as home to the point as you can possibly desire, and it is enough in all conscience. Thus whereas the Scriptures tell us there is but one God, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> say there are two; one God by nature, another by grace,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62459:11"/> one Supreme, another Inferior, one Greater, another Lesser, one Elder and eternal, the other a junior and modern God: and this by <hi>Socinus</hi> is made the great mystery of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, greater indeed if true, and more incomprehensible then any other, or then all the other stupendous and adorable mysteries of our Faith put together.</p>
                  <p>Now as the <hi>Socinians</hi> say there are two Gods; so if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> he will confidently tell you there are three; who tho he be no <hi>Socinian,</hi> yet he agrees perfectly with them in <hi>allmost all</hi> their other Errors, except that which concerns the doctrine of the Trinity, where he hath a peculiar notion of his own, distinct as he tells you both from <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> for he makes the Son and Holy Ghost to have a divine nature communicated to them from all eternity, but yet such that is different in each of them, so that they are three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct divine beings. And to the objection made by <hi>Maresius,</hi> that this notion must inevitably imply that there are three Gods; he Answers, that if by three Gods, be meant three spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically distinguished from each other, he disowns any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the persons of the Trinity; but if by three, be meant three persons agreeing in the same common nature, yet numerically distinguished in each of them, it is that which he ownes and earnestly contends for; that the Father, Son and Holy-Ghost, are as much three Gods as <hi>Peter Paul,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> agreeing in the same common nature are three distinct men. And if you believe him, he will tell you the ancients were not afraid of the imputation of <hi>Poytheisme,</hi> in this sense; and to think of the same individual nature being communicated to three persons, was a notion that never entered into the heads of any of the Fathers, in their disputes against the <hi>Arians,</hi> as being against both Reason and Religion. <hi>Curcell. Dissert. prima de vocibus Trinit. &amp;c. cap. 105. &amp; deinceps.</hi> And <hi>Limburg,</hi> who publishes and recommends him to the world, I suppose is of the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d</hi> Attribute which the Scriptures ascribe to God, is his immensity and omnipresence, assuring us that his nature is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and consequently that it cannot be confined to any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62459:12"/> place, or circumscribed within any limits. Tho he is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly and eminently resident in Heaven, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell us that <hi>Heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contein him,</hi> 1 King. 8. 27. and the <hi>Psalmist</hi> puts the question, <hi>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there also.</hi> Ps. 139. 7, 8. So St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7. 48. <hi>the most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands,</hi> that is, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within those limits, as many of the Heathens thought their Gods were, for, <hi>as saith the Prophet, heaven is my Throne, and the earth is my footstool.</hi> And indeed not only the infinite nature of God, but the belief of his providence necessarily supposes it. Upon which account we are said <hi>in him to live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. forasmuch as he <hi>is above all, and through all, and in all.</hi> Eph. 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>Now in opposition to this important Truth, which is not only revealed in Scripture, but dictated by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and acknowledged upon that score to be such, by all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Heathens, as well as by sound Christians; the <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell you, that God is not infinite in his Essence, or Nature, but that he is so confined to the Heavens, as not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially present elsewhere, or not to fill any places out of those limits. And therefore when urged with those places of Scripture, which say that God <hi>fills Heaven and Earth,</hi> and that he is <hi>every where present,</hi> Jer. 23. 24. Ps. 139. They answer, that they must be Interpreted, only with respect to the vertue, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and operations of God, which extend to the remotest places where he is not essentially present. <note n="1" place="bottom">

As the Sun, which is the Instance some of them give us to illustrate this matter, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Heavens, and indeed takes up but a small roome there in comparison, yet may be said to be, <hi>ubique terrarum,</hi> because he diffuses his Light, Heat, and other Influences, to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62459:12"/> the remotest parts of the Earth. But of this Attribute more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3d</hi> Attribute ascribed to God in Scripture, is his omniscience, whereby he knows all things past, present, and to come, which knowledge of his extends it self not only to all things and persons, but likewise to all their actions and the effects of them, and together with them views the secret springs and principles of those actions, discerning the designs and contrivances of men, and all the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>There being no creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 13.</p>
                  <p>What our Translation renders open, is more Emphatically expressed in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all things are as it were dissected and anatomized, the very inside of all things are laid open to his view. What is lodged in the darkest corners and deepest recesses of the Soul, cannot be hid from his sight, whose eies are in every place like a flame of fire beholding the evil and the good. Nay this knowledge is of so vast an extent, as to comprehend within its mighty compass, not only things past and present, but likewise all things to come; for his duration being commensurate to all the parts of time, he doth not measure things as we do, by first and last, but all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to come, are open to him at one view, <hi>with whom a thousand years are but as one day, and one day as a thousand years</hi> 2 Act. 3. 8. Nay not only those things which are properly future with respect to any necessary causes of their producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but even those which are most contingent, as depending upon the spontaneous motion of mens free will; all such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the most casual events, as well as remote consequences of them, are the objects of Gods knowledge, who doth not only discern our Intentions and designs whilst they are <hi>in fieri,</hi> in the time of their hatching and framing in the Soul, but antecedently, long before the mind comes to any determination, he understands our thoughts afar of, <hi>Ps.</hi> 139. 2.</p>
                  <p>And of this besides the plain declarations of Scripture, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that have bin made by God of the most contingent and fortuitous events are an Argument that one would think should
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62459:13"/> place this truth beyond all contradiction: It being that which God Allmighty made choice of, to vindicate the honour of his divine nature and perfections, in opposition to the vain claime that was laid to them by the dull Idols of the heathens, and their more stupid worshippers <hi>Esay. 41. 22. Let them bring forth and shew us what shall happen, let them shew the former things what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them, and declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that you are God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true this knowledge of God as it extends to things to come, is too wonderful for us, we cannot attain to it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we think to measure his knowledge by our own shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low conception of things, we ingage in a task more absurd and ridiculous, then if we should attempt to take up the waters of the Ocean and inclose them in the hollow of our hand.</p>
                  <p>And of this absurdity are the <hi>Socinians</hi> guilty, who will by no means be brought to acknowledge this great truth; for tho when you come to discourse with them upon this subject, they will tell you, they allow God to be omniscient, and that he knows all things; yet you must not be too hasty in taking an advantage of that concession. You must give them leave to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; God knows all things, That's true, but with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>quatenus sunt scibilia,</hi> as far as they are capable of being known. But future contingencies must be excluded out of that number, having no being either in themselves, or in any certain or necessary causes of their production; and therefore are no more the object of any, even divine knowledge, then darkness is the object of sight: your eyes may as soon be dazled with one, as your understandings be affected or receive any Impression from the other.</p>
                  <p>For Gods knowledge say they, is agreeable to the nature of the things known; which may in some sense be true, but is a truth ill applyed by them, when they tell us, that God knows things that are <hi>certain,</hi> as such that <hi>shall</hi> come to pass; things that are <hi>likely,</hi> he considers as such that <hi>may probably</hi> come to pass; things that are <hi>barely possible,</hi> as depending upon the arbitrary, and therefore uncertain determinations of mens
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62459:13"/> free will, he knows as <hi>possible,</hi> that is, they may or may not come to pass, but whether of these two shall happen, that is still a <hi>secret</hi> even to God himself; whose divine knowledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not arrive to the knowledge of such future contingencies, of which according to the known <hi>maxime,</hi> there can be no certain or determinate truth or falsehood.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps you will say this <hi>maxime</hi> is true, with respect to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes, and any <hi>created</hi> knowledge, but not with respect to the knowledge of God, to whom the most <hi>casual</hi> events are present, and therefore certain; for as much as he foresees which way men will freely determine their own choice, either in act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or forbearing to act, in doing this, or doing the contrary. And without this prescience we cannot well imagine how God should be able to governe the world, and particularly Angels and Men, in whose actions and the event of them, his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is so eminently concerned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell you all this is a great mistake, and that such a notion of Gods knowledge is so far from being neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to his providence, that it is derogatory to the freedom of mens will, and thereby leads to the dishonour of God, and the overthrow of all Religion, which <hi>Crellius</hi> endeavours at large to prove <hi>Lib. de Natura Dei cap. 24. de Sapientia Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after he hath taken some pains to shew that this omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is opposite to reason, he comes to shew its repugnance as he thinks to the plain declarations of Scripture, and what he and his Master say upon this head, and upon that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, it will be worth our while a little to enlarge upon, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it will help to give us a true Idaea of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> which tends plainly to the dishonour of God, and in the conclusion to the overthrow of all natural as well as revealed Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now the places of Scripture which he quotes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose▪ are those which speake of Gods waiting for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and repentance of sinners, as he doth in that remarkable manner <hi>Esay. 5. 4. What could I have done more for my vineyard, that I have not allready done to it, and yet when I expected it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?</hi> and v. 7. <hi>When he looked for judgment, behold oppression; for righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

                     </note>, That God here by a new and an extraordinary experiment, made a discovery of the faith and piety of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he was not certain of before he made this tryal of it: And of the execrable Impieties of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which he would scarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they could be guilty of, till he came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on purpose, and made as it were his own eyes the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the truth and certainty of those matters.</p>
                  <p>For a further confirmation of his opinion, he cites those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture where God is said to tempt <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, to make a tryal of his obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 1. and so those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Deut. 8. 2. Judges</hi> 2. 21. where God is said to have lead the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the wilderness forty years, to prove them, and to know what was in their hearts, and whether they would keep his commandments or no: and to have left of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> in the land, declaring his resolution not to drive them out thence, that he might prove <hi>Israel,</hi> whether they would keep the waies of the Lord as their Fathers did or no.

                     </note>, is supported not only by the evidence and strength of reason, but by the Authority of Holy Scripture <note n="4" place="bottom">Crell. Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Crellius</hi> here saith against Gods prescience, he learned from his Master <hi>Socin: Praelect. Theol. Cap. 8. p.</hi> 585.

                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quae ne in hominem cadere potest, nisi plane dementem.</hi> Ibid.</note>, which we cannot imagine any man could be lyable to, except he were <hi>stark mad.</hi> And then quotes the places before cited by <hi>Crellius,</hi> and to them adds <hi>Num. 14. 12. &amp;c.</hi> where God sware that the <hi>Israelites</hi> should not enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which yet he sware to their forefathers he would give them, and he did once really intend to put them in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, but their murmurings and rebellions caused him to alter his resolution.</p>
                  <p>Now if God had <hi>foreseen</hi> the disobedience and impieties of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> which moved him to change his purpose concerning them, in promising to bring them into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and confirming that promise with an oath; he must have acted, saith this <hi>Bold man,</hi> so, as we cannot suppose any man to have acted, that was not <hi>quite out of his wits</hi>

But now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all this, the foretelling of future events, even such as are most contingent, as depending upon the intire freedom of mens will; and the numerous as well as plain predictions of these matters which stand upon record in the book of God, one would think should be an <hi>unanswerable objection.</hi> And it seems it was so with <hi>Episcopius,</hi> who though he agrees too well with <hi>Socinus</hi> in many of his other <hi>loose and dangerous</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of God, yet here he leaves him, and declares himselfe of a contrary Opinion, being chiefly induced thereunto from this Argument of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
                  <p>But yet to mollify the matter, and to give as litle offence as might be, to a party whose favor he courted, he tells them and us <note n="3" place="bottom">Lib. 4. Inst.

                  <p n="2">2. God foretells some actions, and particularly some wicked actions, not as if he knew they would certainly be committed by evil men, <hi>Quia ea certissime futura nosset, sed quia sic plane verisimile erat,</hi> Ibid. but because it was very likely they should be so: that is, what we call a <hi>prediction,</hi> and what the Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any limitation delivers as such, <hi>Socinus</hi> accounts but a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi> it is a <hi>probable guess,</hi> of what <hi>may</hi> likely come to pass; But what may come to pass, <hi>may</hi> likewise not come to pass, and so for all their <hi>confidence,</hi> the inspired writers, and what we cannot think of without horror, the Holy Spirit that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them might be mistaken. But forasmuch as these two former Answers may serve for some predictions, but cannot give a reasonable Enquirer just satisfaction as to others, which are so plain that the force of them cannot be thus eluded.</p>
                  <p>Therefore once for all to put an end to this objection, and you may well imagine he was hard <hi>pressed,</hi> before he would betake himself to this <hi>last,</hi> and in him a <hi>desperate shift;</hi> he is forced to take sanctuary at those very decrees of God, which at other times he opposes with all his might: like a <hi>Malefactor</hi> when closely pursued, and finding no other way of

                  <p>2. That Freedom and Necessity are so opposite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Omnipotence it self cannot reconcile them, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are plain contradictions, and terms that destroy each other <note n="5" place="bottom">

That necessity robs you not only of your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but of your will it self, to which freedom is so necessary, that without it is no will, it being an essential property of it, <hi>proprium quarto modo;</hi> and to say that the Will can subsist without its property, that is it's <hi>essential liberty,</hi> is <hi>absurditate ipsa absurdius</hi>
                     <note n="6" place="bottom">Exam. Censurae Conf. Remonst. cap. 6. p. 76.</note>. Now let us put both these things together: there is no Religion, consequently neither Good nor Evil, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue nor Vice, where there is necessity; and yet <hi>nihil prohibet,</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:62459:16"/> saith <hi>Crell.</hi> nothing, consequently neither religion, nor the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of good and evil hinders, but that God may absolutely decree things good to be done <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Nihil prohibet quin Deus simpliciter bona fieri decernat.</hi> Crell. de sap. Dei p. 210.</note>, and decree them so as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come necessary by vertue of that decree.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Will cannot be <hi>necessitated</hi> in any of its actions, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as this would destroy its freedom, which is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal radical property of it, and cannot be separated from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destroying the Will it self: And yet God can <hi>impose a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> upon the <hi>wills</hi> of men of choosing this thing or another <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Potest necessitatem homini imponere hoc vel illud volendi.</hi> Ibid.</note>: and <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell you, that God usually leaves the <hi>wills</hi> of men to their freedom, <hi>except</hi> it be when his judgments require him to lay them under a necessity <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Deus voluntatem liberam esse sinit, nisi quando ut ei necessitatem afferat, ejus judicia requirant.</hi> Socin. Praelect. Th. cap. 7. p 544.</note>. Now how shall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile these sayings, which to us poor Christians seem to be plain contradictions, and therefore impossible to be true. But <hi>Socinus</hi> is not only a great admirer of reason, but a great master of it too; and therefore by the help of a distinction, he doubts not but to bring himselfe fairly off; for in the forementioned place, having in order to give an account of some of the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture, bin forced to bring in the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God into his assistance, which could not one would think, but <hi>entrench upon the freedome</hi> of mans will, by making all actions subject to these Decrees necessary; he gravely tells us, and we are behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him for the discovery; That notwithstanding his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, God hath left man entirely to his liberty; for besides the direction and government of his <hi>external actions which indeed God hath reserved</hi> to himselfe, he hath left every thing else in the power of mans will <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Voluntas hominis ad Extremum usque est plane libera, adeo ut praeter ipsum factum Externum, omnia in ejus sunt potestate.</hi> ibid.</note>. That is, when you say a man is a <hi>free Agent,</hi> you must distinguish between the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Act, between <hi>choosing</hi> and <hi>dooing;</hi> in the former sense a man is entirely at liberty, for what can be freer then thought, who can lay a restraint upon mans will, or shakle his desires?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62459:16"/> the decrees of God, can put no force upon these, and here <hi>Sapiens dominabitur astris;</hi> they only governe mens <hi>outward actions,</hi> which may indeed become thereby necessary, <hi>but that's no great matter; animus cujusque est quisque,</hi> the <hi>mind</hi> is the nobler part, let a man but assert the honour and dignity of that; and he need not be much concerned what becomes of his <hi>outward</hi> actions. But against this it may be objected, that a great part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion consists in the practise of many External actions of <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards men; and if these are not free, they are no longer Acts of Religion, any thing else but not Vertue and Vice as was said before. To this he will tell you, that God measures mens Obedience or Disobedience respectively, not by the <hi>External Fact,</hi> but by the <hi>Internal Actions and consent of the Will</hi>
                     <seg rend="sup">2</seg>.</p>
                  <p>Which tho' in some sense, and with a just limitation may be true; yet as it is here brought in by him, to serve his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, is a very <hi>loose and a dangerous determination;</hi> in short this whole matter as it is stated by <hi>Socinus,</hi> is lyable to very many and those unanswerable exceptions.</p>
                  <p>For 1. whereas he saith the will even to the last is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at liberty, tho the external actions are subject to the decrees of God, and thereby become necessary; this is a <hi>plain contradiction</hi> to what both he and <hi>Crellius</hi> before told us, that God might <hi>necessitatem afferre voluntati &amp; necessitatem imponere hominibus hoc vel illud volendi:</hi> force even the will, as well as make the outward actions necessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> He asserts a freedome in men to <hi>little or no purpose;</hi> for one would think if God gave a man a principle of <hi>freedome,</hi> he did it chiefly for the <hi>government of his actions;</hi> and if these are not in his power he had even as good be without his liberty; and that his will and his actions should run the same <hi>fate,</hi> and be both equally subject to it. For my part I should think I had as good be shackled and manacled, as to have a<note place="bottom">
                        <hi>1 Deus Obedientiam &amp; Inobedientiam hominum, ex ipsa perfecta &amp; consummata voluntate, non autem ex ipso Externo facto metitur.</hi> ibid.</note>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62459:17"/> full power of mooving, and yet not be able to stir either hand or foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> If <hi>Socinus</hi> should be asked, how it can be imagined that the actions can be necessary when the principle from whence they proceed is absolutely free, for it is of humane and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary actions that <hi>Socinus</hi> in that place is speaking of, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it would puzzle him to give a satisfactory answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> Tho <hi>Socinus</hi> takes care of the <hi>freedome of mans will,</hi> which he in this place is concerned to vindicate, yet as far as I can perceive he hath little care of <hi>Religion;</hi> for if, where there is necessity there can be no Religion, as the <hi>Socin.</hi> and <hi>Remonstrants</hi> said before, and that a great part of Religion consists in <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> as well as <hi>internal</hi> actions; I cannot see but that thereby Religion is left in great danger if not entirely overthrown, and that <hi>Vertue and Morality,</hi> are for any assistance that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> in this place affords them, fairly left to shift for themselves.</p>
                  <p>Well, but however tho <hi>Socinus</hi> by making good actions sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Gods decrees, and thereby necessary, may be guilty of <hi>Contradicting himself;</hi> yet there is no great harme in all that, his opinion may be absurd, but he doth not design to encourage impiety thereby; for tho he make God the cause of good actions yet he doth not as his adversaries do, make him the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi> In reference to what is <hi>Evil,</hi> here man is left entirely to his own freedome, the guilt of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be transferred upon the decrees of God, which are not in any wise concerned in them; but the shame and blame of all must be laid at mans own door, and imputed only to his own freedom. But soft and fair, there is no general rule but may have some exceptions, for there are plain predictions in Scripture, not only of <hi>some good,</hi> but of many <hi>evil and wicked actions,</hi> such for instance, as were the Treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the denyal of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now these according to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> God could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see except they were necessary, and they could not well be necessary without his decree, and therefore to reconcile the prediction and the event, God first resolves to have an ill thing done, and then wisely foretells the doing of it. Read
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62459:17"/> what follows and then you will be further satisfyed in this matter, and that <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers are not wronged in laying this to their charge.</p>
                  <p>For first saith <hi>Crellius,</hi> if God finds men fit and disposed for any mischief, <hi>Eorum malitia uti potest ad consilia sua exequenda</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">Crell. cap. 24. De Sapientia Dei. p. 210.</note>, he may make use of their wickedness to compass his own <hi>designes.</hi> Nay not only so, he may likewise decree somthing to be done by them, <hi>Quod sine peccato ab iis fieri nequit,</hi> Ibid. which cannot be done without sin. What <hi>Crellius</hi> saith in general, <hi>Socinus</hi> gives as an example of in the Egyptians, whose sin in oppressing the Children of Israel, God long before fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw and foretold, 15. <hi>Gen.</hi> as having decreed it to be done. But to excuse this matter he saith, God did not put that wicked disposition into the minds of the Egyptians, but found it there, <hi>Malam eam mentem in ipsis invenerat, qua ad judicium suum exequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, quodammodo abusus est.</hi> Praelect. Th. cap. 10. p. 547. and what he found there, he made use of for the execution of his judgments.</p>
                  <p>This is somthing but it is not full enough, this is but beating about the bush, therefore he will keep you noe longer in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense. Not only an action that could not be done without sin, but the sin it selfe may be decreed and effected by God, <hi>Si quid ab hominibus contra Dei legem committitur id non quidem decernente ac autore Deo fieri asseveramus, nisi raro ac quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de causis,</hi> Socin. Prael. Th. p. 544. that is, if God be the Author of sin it is but rarely, and that for very weighty reasons. Here again <hi>Socinus</hi> to our great amazement, is a downright predestinarian, and if we may judge of the opinions of <hi>Calvin</hi> even by the representation of his adversaries, he is <hi>Calvino ipso Calvinior.</hi> What <hi>Socinus</hi> here affirms, that God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is the Author of mens sins, is confirmed by <hi>Smalcius,</hi> but with this difference, that whereas by <hi>Socinus</hi> God is made the immediate Author of sin, <hi>Smalcius</hi> will bring in the Devil to bear part of the blame, <hi>deum quandoque per diabolum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes compellere ad scelera perpetranda</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">Smal. Contra Frantz. p. 416.</note>. God indeed saith he, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62459:18"/> men to do evil, but he maks use of the ministry of the Devil, who is the instrument in the Compulsion.</p>
                  <p>What they thus say in general, they doe further illustrate, if you think what hath bin said may not be so clear, but that it may want a Comment, by particular instances, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Peters denial of his Master, which was a <hi>Contingent Event</hi> one would think, as depending upon the freedome of his will; and yet this was foretold by Christ. But how could this be? why <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell you this denial of Peter, was not a matter so Contingent as you may imagine; for God for the punishment of his confidence, decreed to withdraw his Grace from him, upon which substraction of his Grace, that denyal could not but follow <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Negatio ista necessario consecutura erat</hi> Socin. ibid. p. 548.</note>. Nay he goes farther; not only withdrawing his Grace from Peter in the <hi>Hour of Temptation,</hi> but taking <hi>effectual course</hi> that he should be tempted. For saith he, Peter being disposed to commit this sin, and wanting only an <hi>Oppertunity</hi> of putting it into practise, to make good the truth of his prediction, God took care to offer him <hi>that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</hi> And this he thinks may safely be said, without any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Non alia re opus erat, nisi ut occasio Christum negandi Petro daretur. id quod deum ipsum curas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se i. e. Effecisse, nihil absurdi continet.</hi> Vid. Smal. Contra Frantz. p. 431. <hi>Ubi as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit voluntatem Petri quoddammodo esse coactam &amp; ad breve temporis spacium liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate sua privatam, idque Deum interdum &amp; facere posse &amp; solere.</hi>
                     </note>. Here he speaks home and full to the point.</p>
                  <p>Indeed at another time he himself can scarce <hi>digest,</hi> what he here would have his Readers <hi>swallow without straining;</hi> for saith he, to say that God <hi>foresees evil, because he decrees it, cannot be affirmed without impiety</hi>
                     <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Peccata ita à deo nota fuisse affirmare, quia futura omnino ita decrevisset, impium prorsus videri debet.</hi> Ibid. p. 547.</note>. How shall we reconcile this with all we before quoted out of him? I confess I was in some paine for him, to know how he would come off, but he soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived me, by the help of a distinction he can performe wonders, among which, one of the greatest is to <hi>reconcile contradictions.</hi> For saith he, <hi>Si certa mali operis praedictio erit, ipsum quidem opus à deo decretum fuerit, non autem cordis malitia,</hi> p. 549.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62459:18"/> That is, you must distinguish between the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Obliquity</hi> of it, and then you may reconcile the honour of <hi>Gods justice</hi> and the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>predictions:</hi> a very nice and Methaphysical distinction, and which I should almost despaired to have found any where, but in the writings of a <hi>Schoolman</hi> or a <hi>Calvinist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I think we have reason to admire the <hi>Judgment</hi> of God, upon these men; in giving them up, as a <hi>just punishment</hi> of their Contempt of his <hi>Revelations,</hi> to the <hi>Conduct</hi> of their own <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>Corrupt Reason,</hi> which when it is not assisted by a Divine Revelation, is but a blind guide in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion; and therefore it is no wonder if we find them roving and wandring in a Laberynth and Maze of Errors, like men bewildred, going backward and forward, saying and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying, and at length growing giddy, and falling back into those very opinions which they have made so much hast to fly from, and upon the account of which, they and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants have raised so many, and such <hi>Tragical</hi> exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against their adversaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4ly.</hi> The next <hi>Attribute</hi> that the Scriptures ascribe to God, is his Immutability, whereby he is uncapable of <hi>Alteration,</hi> and therefore not <hi>Liable to change.</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 29. <hi>The strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man that he should repent.</hi> This would argue God to be like our selves, of like weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and like passions with men.</p>
                  <p>For whatever <hi>Alterations</hi> may happen in the world, yet he remains <hi>unalterable, with whom is no variableness, neither shaddow of turning.</hi> James 1. 17. Indeed men upon many accounts, and for many very warrantable reasons, may be obliged to shift and change their Counsels and Resolutions, who for want of <hi>wisedom and foresight</hi> in laying their projects, or for want of <hi>strength to execute them,</hi> and by a great many other <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected accidents,</hi> which the greatest prudence could not foresee, nor consequently avoid, oftentimes meet with many and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal disappointments.</p>
                  <p>But when <hi>Infinite Wisedome</hi> is joyned with <hi>Infinite Power.</hi> Nothing can hinder such an <hi>Agent</hi> from bringing his purposes to the desired Event. <hi>My counsel saith the Lord, that shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62459:19"/> stand, and I will do all my pleasure, Esay.</hi> 46. 10. Who can withstand the power of God? who can baffle his Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? or resist his will? For the Counsels and Decrees of God are as <hi>Immutable</hi> as his Nature; for be they Absolute, or be they Conditional, as long as he foresees the performance of the Condition, it makes no difference in this case: many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices may be in mans heart, <hi>but the counsel of the Lord that shall stand</hi> Prov. 19. 21. however men may alter; and the dealings and <hi>dispensations of Gods providence</hi> in several acts of mercy and justice upon that score, may be different towards them: yet this is without <hi>alteration</hi> or change in his purposes towards them, <hi>who remains still the same, yesterday and to day and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Socinians utter many bold and <hi>dangerous</hi> expressions in opposition to this plain truth, which is the unavoydable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of their denyal of his Omniscience. Forasmuch as there are many events which depend upon the actions of men, which arising from the freedom of their Will, are therefore purely <hi>contingent,</hi> and consequently out of the reach of <hi>Gods knowledge;</hi> this must according to them <hi>unavoydably</hi> cause God to alter his councels, to take <hi>new measures,</hi> to change his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions towards men, and alter his <hi>purposes concerning them:</hi> that is, he who is a <hi>Reprobate</hi> to day, may be an <hi>Elect</hi> person to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and he who at present is elect, may afterwards be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and those may <hi>finally perish, quos Deus saluti destinavit,</hi> whom God once <hi>designed</hi> for eternal happiness. <hi>Socin, de Off. hominis Christiani,</hi> cap. 11. Now this one would think should be an Argument of <hi>inconstancy,</hi> and consequently not fit to be ascribed to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Crellius</hi> will tell you, there is no such matter; this is only an <hi>instance of his freedome,</hi> it shews you only that there is <hi>a variety</hi> in the acts of Gods will, <hi>but no inconstancy.</hi> For a man is then said to be constant to his purpose, who persists in it till some good reason obliges him to alte it <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Constantis est persistere in animi proposito, nisi quid intervenerit, cujus ratio non immerito haberi possit, &amp; quod in aliam sententiam voluntatem jure flectere queat.</hi> Crell. cap. 25. de Sanct. Dei, p. 265.</note>, and therefore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62459:19"/> what you would call wavering, he will say is the result of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quae rebus mutatis ita consilia mutat, ut ea illarum rationi attemperat,</hi> Cap. 32. de Decretis Dei. p. 350.</note>, God accommodating his decrees to the nature of things, and the actions of men; so that in short, <hi>God is subject to change,</hi> but not without good reason, he may alter his purposes as wise men usually do, according to the <hi>different circumstances</hi> of things, and as the exigence of his affairs shall require.</p>
                  <p>But with the leave of this bold man, another would be apt to think, that tho men may without the imputation of Levity alter their counsels, yet this arises from the <hi>imperfection of their natures,</hi> and particularly of their <hi>knowledge of future events,</hi> which tho it be no <hi>fault,</hi> yet it must be acknowledged a <hi>weakness,</hi> tho such a one as they are no more accountable for, then they are, because they cannot restore sight to a man born blind, or raise the dead. But it cannot be ascribed to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>derogation</hi> to his infinite knowledge, and <hi>unerring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and is therefore an argument of weakness, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that <hi>Crellius</hi> urges very weakly to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore that we may return where we first began, to the Decrees of God concerning the future, and final state of men; this is certain, that they with relation to their several and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective objects, are fixed and unmoveable; for be they <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> or <hi>subsequent</hi> to his foresight of mens <hi>faith or infidelity,</hi> it matters not in this case: the Scriptures however assure us, and right reason would confirme the same, that they are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,</hi> more stable then the <hi>Foundations of the Earth,</hi> or the <hi>Poles of the World,</hi> which may and shall be shaken, and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out of their places like drunken men, <hi>but the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For let holyness and perseverance be the cause or the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Gods election, yet all sober persons agree in this, that whoever lives a holy life, and perseveres in it, <hi>is undoubtedly chosen</hi> by God to eternal life, and whosoever lives and dies in his <hi>sins and impenitence,</hi> is certainly designed and shall be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62459:20"/> doomed to everlasting punishment: <hi>here the foundation of the Lord standeth sure, the Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi> and them that are not so. But <hi>Socinus</hi> who denys the certainty of Gods knowledge of many future events, <hi>viz.</hi> those which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, such as are the actions of men, as depending upon the <hi>uncertain because free</hi> motions of their will; must in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of this principle, deny the certainty of Gods Election; because he cannot foresee who will obey his commands and continue to do so, against all the temptations which they will meet with in the world to the contrary: and consequently he must say, what another would account Impiety to think, that God allmighty for <hi>want of knowing</hi> the determination of mens choice, must likewise <hi>be ignorant</hi> of the final event of their actions: and therefore he who at present is the object of his Love, and designed by him for the joys of heaven, may in the conclusion for ought he knows, merit his displeasure, and be tumbled down to hell.</p>
                  <p>Now that men may make such <hi>uncertain conjectures</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their final state, and thereupon meet with <hi>a fatal and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible disappointment,</hi> may be a certain tho a sad truth, and therefore no great wonder: But to think that it should thus happen to the <hi>Allwise creator of men,</hi> is to have too mean and dishonourable conceptions of him; and such the <hi>Socinians</hi> have, doubting not to aver, that God finds reason to alter not only his dispensations towards men according to their behavior, but his own intentions of kindness and displeasure, choosing what at first he refused, and refusing afterwards what once he thought worthy of his Approbation and choice, <hi>Socin. prael.

                     <hi>A fifth Attribute in God,</hi> and which indeed cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him, without overthrowing all Religion, is his Justice: and that not only as it signifies, <hi>his holyness and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> but as it betokens his <hi>anger, indignation, his severity</hi> and <hi>displeasure</hi> against Sin and Sinners. And this the Scripture speaks very often of, <hi>Ps.</hi> 5. the Psalmist describes God as one not only <hi>that hath no pleasure in wickedness,</hi> v. 4. which arises from the holyness and righteousness of his nature, but as one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62459:20"/> likewise that <hi>hates all the workers of iniquity,</hi> v. 5. and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, who abhors the deceitful, and will destroy the Lying man. <hi>The wicked and him that loveth violence his Soul abhors,</hi> Ps. 11. 5. Hence he stiles himself a jealous God, jealous of his authority and honour, and will revenge the contempt of it: <hi>he</hi> is slow to anger, but yet will not acquit the wicked, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he is jealous, and furious, who <hi>will take vengeance on his adversaries, and reserves wrath for his enemies, Nahum,</hi> 2, 3. and when God proclaims his name, the name by which he desires to be known, it is the <hi>God merciful and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but yet one that will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. Numb. 14. 18. <hi>he is</hi> Deus ultionum, <hi>the God to whom vengeance belongeth,</hi> Ps. 94. 1. <hi>the God of recompences,</hi> Jer. 51. 56. and in <hi>short, a consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 29.</p>
                  <p>All which expressions seeme plainly to denote, that Justice in God is a necessary and an essential attribute, and which you can no more separate from him then you can his nature: I mean that Justice which betokens his <hi>severity and indignation</hi> against sinners, and moves and enclines him to punish them, tho the punishment it self may in some sense be said to be <hi>arbitrary,</hi> and subject to the freedome of Gods will; as are also the <hi>Emanations of his goodness,</hi> and the <hi>effects</hi> of his power: but yet all this doth not hinder but that power and goodness may be essential Attributes of God, and are acknowledged so to be by the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves: and the like we affirme of <hi>Justice,</hi> to the terrible effects of which, the Sins of men ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them necessarily obnoxious: all Guilt which is the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table consequence of Sin, being in its own nature an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punishment.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Socinus,</hi> will furnish you with new notions concerning God in this matter, and quite different then what either Jews or Christians have conceived of him. For he will tell you, that Justice and Mercy in God, not only as to <hi>their external effects</hi> as they are discovered in rewards and punishments, but likewise in themselves are not attributes essentially belonging to God, but are things purely arbitrary and indifferent: and particularly that justice as it bespeaks a hatred of sin and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62459:21"/> against the workers of iniquity, is not a <hi>permanent property,</hi> or as he loves to speak <hi>a quality</hi> residing in God, which belongs to him <hi>per se,</hi> but <hi>ex accidente,</hi> that is, it is a matter purely contingent, and the effect only of his <hi>free and mutable will</hi>

                  <p>Now this as it is laid down by the <hi>Socinians</hi> I take to be not only a false but a dangerous position; forasmuch as it furnishes us with such a notion of God as is <hi>dishonorable of him,</hi> and will naturally lead us to a contempt of him. But before I come to prove this, (forasmuch as I take it to be a matter of great importance in it self, and especially is so in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who have introduced this notion of God without Justice, in order to destroy the <hi>true reason</hi> of Christs death and sufferings, which was to give <hi>satisfaction to the Justice</hi> of God for the sins of mankind,) I must crave leave to lay down certain positions, which tho I might take for granted, and call postulata, as being commonly known and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truths: yet I shall as I go along endeavour to prove them so.</p>
                  <p>The first thing therefore which I shall lay down, is, that if there be a <hi>Providence,</hi> it must be chiefly and principally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the care and government of human affairs: for there can be no imaginable reason assigned, nay it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reason to suppose, that God should take care of <hi>Beasts and Inanimate Creatures,</hi> and neglect one of the noblest parts of the Creation, I mean man, for whose sake chiefly, next to his own Glory, he created the visible world, and to whom as to his <hi>vicegerant</hi> he hath given the Dominion over the works of his hand, having put all things under his feet.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:62459:21"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> There can be no <hi>providence</hi> nor care of human affairs without giving men <hi>Laws</hi> for the government of their actions: for as his providence towards other creatures is seen, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them certain laws of motion and rest suitable to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective natures, and in guiding and governing them so, as may most tend to his own glory, and the welfare and beauty of the universe: so his <hi>government and care of men</hi> consists in giving them certain laws as Rules of their actions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; it being much more requisite upon many accounts that they should act by a certain direction; forasmuch as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and mischief that must be the consequence of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly living must be far greater, and more repugnant to the nature and righteousness of God, then if other creatures should swerve from the Laws of their creation; which yet they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably observe, except when God thinks fit to <hi>interpose,</hi> for the ends of his own Glory, and the good of men.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> That the violation of a Law naturally and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon that very score makes a man <hi>lyable to punishusent:</hi> which is but the same thing tho in other words with the foregoing proposition: for therefore are we <hi>obliged</hi> to yield obedience to Laws, because if we refuse to do so, we are thereby <hi>obnoxious to punishment.</hi> This is that which in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law is called, <hi>Jus seu obligatio delicti, quo quis ab malefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and poenam tenetur.</hi> The prescribing of a Law is the act of

                  <p>Lastly, That there is a necessary relation between punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and justice, whose office among other things is to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute rewards and punishments. I do not say that Justice is allways <hi>obliged to exact the punishment,</hi> which the Delinquent is allwaies and necessarily <hi>obliged</hi> to suffer, I mean is necessarily obnoxious to; but wherever there is punishment if just, it must flow from that <hi>Habit or Attribute</hi> which we call <hi>Justice;</hi> and that not only as it bespeaks <hi>Righteousness and Equity;</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as it signifies that <hi>severity and indignation</hi> which every lawgiver is supposed to conceive against him that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Laws, who thereby violates his Authority and offends against the publick good.</p>
                  <p>It hath bin doubted indeed whether in humane punishments, the Civil Magistrate may aime at the vindicating of his own Authority, consider'd abstractedly from the publick good. And here that famous passage of Seneca <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Nemo prudens punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccetur: revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri enim praeterita non possunt, futura prohibentur,</hi> Lib. 1. de Clem. Cap. 6.</note> is often cited upon this occasion, which he translated out of <hi>Plato de Leg. no wise man punishes</hi> a fault because it hath bin committed, but least the like should be committed again: for what is past cannot be recalled, but wise and good men in punishment aime at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting mischief for the future.</p>
                  <p>But tho this may be true with respect to men, yet it is not so with regard to Allmighty God, to whom as <hi>Grotius</hi> in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62459:22"/> the forementioned Book and Chapter <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. hath very true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and judiciously observed, those sayings of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> would be very ill applyed; forasmuch as God in punishing the sins of men, may very righteously, and oftentimes doth aime at nothing but the asserting of his own honour, and vindicating the authority of his Laws, and in short, the <hi>revenging the contempt and violation of them:</hi> as is evident in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain invisible <hi>punishments</hi> inflicted upon some sinners in this life, such as are <hi>obduration</hi> and giving them up to a <hi>Reprobate</hi> sense; and will be much more evident in those <hi>everlasting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> (for so we will make bold to call them whatever the <hi>Socin.</hi> may say to the contrary) in the life to come, where God can aime at nothing but the <hi>satisfaction of his Justice,</hi> and thereby the manifestation of his own Glory <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>But whatever the reasons may be of inflicting punishment either by God or man, yet Justice is the hand that inflicts it: which is called <hi>distributive</hi> or <hi>vindictive,</hi> and is therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by an <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>Now these things being thus premised, I proceed to make good my charge against the <hi>Socin.</hi> in calling that not only a <hi>false but a dangerous Opinion</hi> of theirs, which makes Justice to be no <hi>necessary or essential Attribute</hi> in God, but a matter pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Arbitrary and Contingent,</hi> as being the effect only of his free will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st.</hi> Then this Opinion I say is false and impious, because it furnishes us with such an Idaea of God as is <hi>dishonourable</hi> of him and will naturally lead us to a contempt of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it teaches us so to conceive of God, as of one that is not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62459:23"/> necessarily concerned in the Actions of men and the affairs of the World: that is, it gives us a notion of a God <hi>without a providence;</hi> for if there be a providence, it must chiefly and principally be imployed (as was said in our first Prop) in the <hi>care and government of Human Affairs;</hi> there can be no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without Laws, no Laws without the sanctions of Punishment, either expressed or necessarily implyed in all such Laws; no punishment without Justice to inflict it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently (that we may bring both ends of our <hi>Sorites</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) where there is no justice, there is no providence; and where the one is not necessary, the other is not so too. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho the <hi>Socin.</hi> do acknowledge Gods providence and that he doth actually govern the World, yet this doth not take off the charge of falshood and impiety from this position of theirs; because thereby they make his providence to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent and perfectly an arbitrary matter; you may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this have a true notion of God and do him no wrong, if you conceive of him as one that may be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the actions of men, who after he hath sent them into the world, may suffer them to live as they please, every man doing that which is right in his own eies: which yet is great Impiety so much as to imagin; forasmuch as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the infinite perfections of Allmighty God, helps to debase him in our thoughts, to weaken that reverence and esteem which arises in our minds when we conceive of him; and thereby leads us naturally and inevitably from a disesteem to a denyal of him.</p>

But you will say that God may give men Laws for the government of their Actions, and that will be a sufficient <hi>vindication of his providence,</hi> tho he assigns no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the breach of them. That is, tho we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>a God without a providence,</hi> yet we may <hi>conceive a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence without Justice.</hi> Indeed <hi>Socinus</hi> hath told us so, for speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the command of God to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, Requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him not to eat of the forbidden fruit, and the threatning annexed, <hi>In the day thou eatest thou shalt dye the death, Gen.</hi> 3. which <hi>threatning Covet,</hi> his adversary told him, did flow from that <hi>Justice</hi> in God which we have hitherto bin speaking of; he Answers, <hi>that this Justice was not any thing in God inbaering in him, and therefore nothing could flow from it, as being only an accidental effect of his free will:</hi>

                        <hi>Quod verum esse deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur, si consideremus, potuisse Deum praeceptum illud homini tradere, neque ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men poenam Mortis, si illud non servasset addere: Immo ne poenam quidem ullam.</hi> Ibid.</note> that God might have given <hi>Adam</hi> (and what God might have done to <hi>Adam,</hi> he might undoubtedly have done to all the Sons and posterity of <hi>Adam</hi>) this law, and not have annexed Death as the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the breach of it, nay if he had so pleased he might have assigned no punishment at all.</p>
                  <p>But this is delivered by <hi>Socinus</hi> with the same <hi>Confidence</hi> as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62459:24"/> are many of his other absurd <hi>Errors,</hi> in which he stands sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle by himself, against the constant and uniform suffrage of Divines Ancient and Moderne, Fathers and Schoolmen, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Lawyers, and those both Canonists and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians: among whom it passes for an uncontrouled maxim, That, that is very vainly and <hi>impertinently commanded</hi> which may be <hi>securely neglected. Frustra est aliquid praecipere, quod impuné potest negligi:</hi> and this bold position he lays down, and gives us not the least reason for it, but his own affirmation. But tho he gives us no reason for his assertion, I am sure there is very great as well as very apparent reason against it; forasmuch as such Laws as these will neither secure the honour of God, nor serve the ends of his providence; being but in the nature of good advice, which as we said before, every man is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to take, or refuse at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>So that while he makes the Law precarious, at the same time and for the same reason he makes the Obedience of men so too: in which case God must be beholding not to his own <hi>Authority,</hi> but to the <hi>good nature</hi> of his Creatures, that they yeild any obedience to his commands. Perhaps you will say there may be other <hi>obligations,</hi> besides those of punishment which men may be under to practise their duty: such as are those of <hi>Honour and Gratitude,</hi> and the strong tye of Reason, which will bind a man to comply with his Duty, if there were no other motive to it, but this, that to do otherwise will be to act unsuitably to the dignity of his nature.</p>
                  <p>All this may be fine in speculation, but will signifie little when reduced to practise: the generality of men being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>by sense,</hi> the motions of which are too <hi>headstrong</hi> and <hi>furious</hi> to be curbed by the bare commands of reason, when they are not enforced with the <hi>fear of punishment:</hi> the voice of which will be as feeble as that of old <hi>Eli</hi> to his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sons, far too weak to master their violence: and therefore that <hi>Frantick woman</hi> that some have talked of, who brought fire in one hand to burn up Paradise, and water in the other to quench the flames of Hell, if she had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her design, instead of promoting would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62459:24"/> all vertue, and soon have rooted it out of the world.</p>
                  <p>In short, to summe up what hath been said upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: if there be no <hi>Justice naturally in God,</hi> there might have bin no <hi>Providence,</hi> and if no providence, then men might have bin left to the conduct of their own <hi>giddy and unruly passions,</hi> which would soon break through the restraints of reason; and when men were thus left to the government of <hi>Lust and Sense,</hi> the unavoidable consequence of this must have bin, that the world would have bin filled with <hi>Blood and Murders,</hi> with <hi>Impurity and Ʋncleanness,</hi> with <hi>Theft and Rapine,</hi> with <hi>Injustice and Oppression,</hi> and the gentle race of men would soon have become worse then the worst of wild Beasts, preying upon and devouring one another. And to suppose that God could be <hi>unconcerned</hi> at all this, as if there be no <hi>Justice</hi> in him which enclines him to punish such wickedness, he might be; is to have such a notion of God as it is reported <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had of his Leaden God which he carried about him, and when he had caused any man to be Murderd, or done the like mischief, he would take it into his hands, and kiss it, and beg pardon, and then all was well again, and he himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came immediatly safe if not innocent. In short at this rate, we should not dishonour God if we so conceived of him, as of one who did not <hi>necessarily</hi> act according to the <hi>eternal and unalterable Rules of Wisdome, Goodness, and Righteousness,</hi> that he might be a God not of Order but Confusion, which is not only an <hi>Impious,</hi> but a <hi>Blasphemous</hi> assertion.</p>

                     <hi>2ly,</hi> My second reason why I account this Position of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> about Gods justice to be false and dangerous, is because it takes away the distinction between <hi>Laws Positive and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;</hi> which distinction hath hitherto bin looked upon, not only to be <hi>true</hi> but <hi>sacred;</hi> forasmuch as the contrary would open a Gap to all manner of impiety and wickedness. Now <hi>positive</hi> Laws are accounted such as owe their original only to Gods free will and pleasure; and therefore as they cannot be known, so they cannot oblige any but those to whom he hath made such a declaration, and discovery of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

B. &amp; P. Lib. 1. Cap. 1. Sect. 10.</note>
                     <hi>Natural Laws are those which are discovered by the light of nature, as being the necessary result of our Constitution, and that relation which we bear to God as rational Creatures: many of which tho revealed in Scripture, yet in themselves they are obligatory, antecedent to any such revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these Laws do necessarily suppose Justice in God, without which they would be insignificant: for tho natural Laws owe their Original to the holyness of God, as being but a transcript of those essential Rules of righteousness which make up his nature; yet all their <hi>force and obligation,</hi> (without which they are not properly Laws) results from his <hi>Justice;</hi> that is, from the fear of punishment, which the <hi>Law threatens,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice inflicts,</hi> without which they would be perfectly insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. From which by a just and necessary consequence it unavoidably follows, that if there be natural Laws, there must be Justice naturally in God: so on the other hand, if there be no Justice, there can be no Laws of nature, forasmuch as without the former, they can have neither <hi>Force nor Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nor consequently have the <hi>formal reason of Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly</hi> And Lastly, This Opinion of <hi>Socin.</hi> is both false and Impious, because it tends to overthrow all natural Religion, by supplanting that which is the chief if not the only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it in the world, and that is the fear of God. For take away his Justice as this <hi>Socinian</hi> hypothesis doth, and then you have left nothing in him which a man governed by the light of nature need to fear: not his unity, nor his eternity, nor immensity, not his holyness, nor his goodness to be sure; nor Lastly his power which in conjunction with the former, as it necessarily is in God, is as harmless and innocent as either
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62459:25"/> of the former Attributes, when it is not mooved nor excited by a just displeasure and indignation.</p>
                  <p>Imagin therefore a <hi>Socinian</hi> were to discourse a <hi>Pagan,</hi> I would feign know how upon this principle, he could convince him that it were his Duty to worship God, and to live a vertuous life: he might tell him indeed, and tell him with great Truth, that the <hi>Divine nature and perfections</hi> are in themselves a just ground of <hi>Esteem and Adoration:</hi> That vertue hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and those powerful tho invisible charms, as being both agreeable to our Reason, and at the same time serves to promote our wellfare and happyness in this world; yet all this would lay him under no <hi>obligation</hi> to do that, which otherwise would be <hi>highly reasonable</hi> and fitting to be done: suppose it be <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> suppose it <hi>rational,</hi> suppose it his <hi>Interest,</hi> yet he is left to his <hi>liberty,</hi> and may, and no doubt will do what he pleases for all that: he may act indeed like a fool and a Bruit, yet he is guilty of no sin in the mean time; for where there is no <hi>Justice,</hi> there can be no <hi>fear of punishment,</hi> where there is no punishment, there is no obligation, nor consequently Law; and where there is no Law, there can be no transgression. So that tho his reason may upbraid him with the folly, his Conscience in this case would never <hi>check him</hi> for the <hi>guilt of his vices;</hi> which if the <hi>Laws of his Country</hi> did not take some care to prevent, he might securely practise without any fear of <hi>Gods displeasure.</hi> In short, notwithstanding all the fine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses about the beauty and aimableness of religion and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; the inclinations of sense, would soon beare down the dictates of Reason, and the <hi>slightest temptations</hi> would prove too strong for these <hi>aery speculations;</hi> and as to the generality, the conclusion which they would draw from this principle, would be, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we dye,</hi> and after death comes no reckoning or account. <hi>Come on let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the Creatures like as in youth: Let us fill our selves with costly ointments, and let no flower of the spring pass by us: Let us crown our selves with Rose buds before they are withered, Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: Let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62459:26"/> every place; for this is our portion, and our Lot in this.</hi> Wisd. 2. v. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>But tho this notion overturns all <hi>natural Religion,</hi> yet it is it self effectually overthrown by the dictates of <hi>natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> which are an unanswerable proof both of <hi>the existence</hi> and the <hi>justice of God:</hi> for we must know that Conscience is something more then <hi>bare Reason:</hi> for Reason may <hi>direct,</hi> but Conscience will <hi>prescribe;</hi> Reason gives us a <hi>Rule</hi> for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our actions, Conscience passes that <hi>Rule into a Law,</hi> gives it its force and obligation. <hi>The</hi>

                        <hi>Facultas injungendi aliquid per modum Legis aut praecepti infert superioritatem, quemadmodum obligatio parendi arguit nos inferiores esse eo, qui praecipere nobis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test; saltem qua Imperium ejus se extendit: Ob eam causam suis decretis immediate nemo potest obligari irrevocabiliter,</hi> Pussendorf.

                     <hi>prescribing of a Law is the act of a superior, and no man is properly superior to himself, and consequently no man can by his own act, peremptorily oblige himself, except that act be enforced by some other and higher obligation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore Conscience is not <hi>bare Reason,</hi> but reason as it is <hi>Gods vicegerent,</hi> cloathed with his Authority, armed with his Justice: and therefore in a more <hi>Imperious way</hi> it commands our obedience, not only perswading us to our duty, but threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the neglect of it: it puts on a <hi>Majestick Ayre,</hi> tells us this must be done, or refuse it at your peril: indeed it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the office, and susteins the person of a <hi>Legislator, a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a Judge:</hi> first <hi>prescribes</hi> a Law, then <hi>accuses</hi> for our disobedience, and lastly <hi>solemnly arraigns</hi> the Sinner for his guilt, and then passes sentence upon him. So that these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Conscience and the Tribunal that God hath erected there, are one of the clearest and most <hi>uncontroled</hi> proofs of a future Judgment, of which the former are a kind of <hi>Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed if we look back to former times, and consult the History of Ages and Countries, the most ignorant and barbarous, we shall find, that as the light of nature hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to the <hi>belief and acknowledgment</hi> of a God; so
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62459:26"/> one of the earliest notions that arose in their minds when they have thought of him, hath bin the <hi>Apprehension of his Justice:</hi> of which among other things, the <hi>numerous,</hi> tho many of them <hi>Impious and Ridiculous rites,</hi> which they made use of to appease the anger of their <hi>incensed Deities,</hi> are an irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Argument. And this apprehension of divine Justice, was, as one of the principal causes, so one of the chiefest, if not the only support of natural Religion in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply this to our present purpose, and to bring the parts of our argument a little closer together: If men by the light of nature could discover this Attribute of Justice in God, it must unavoidably follow, that justice in him his natural; for the light of nature can discover nothing in God but what is so: whatever is the effet of Gods <hi>meere pleasure,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of his free will, can never be known but by <hi>Revelation;</hi> and it is impossible it should be otherwise discovered, except we should suppose men to be Omniscient, and that they may know more of God then they can of one another: <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man that is within him?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 11. so much less <hi>can any man discerne the things of God but the spirit of God.</hi> He indeed <hi>searches the deep things of God,</hi> such as are the results of his free pleasure, and the counsel of his will; which lay hidden in the <hi>breast of God,</hi> and must forever have done so, had not he who lay in the <hi>bosome of his Father,</hi> revealed them unto us: and therefore if justice were as the <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, the effect only of Gods free will, it must have lain undiscovered to the Gentile world, to whom God vouchsafed no revelation of his will; which yet is contrary to the account which the Histories of all times and ages have given us of this matter: from whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the belief of Gods Justice among men, is <hi>Coeval</hi> with that of his being, written in the <hi>same Caracters,</hi> and Engraven by the <hi>same Hand,</hi> that implanted the notion of a God in the minds of men; and if so, then the same hand that <hi>defaces</hi> the notion of Gods Justice, must at the same time and for the same reason <hi>Erase</hi> the belief of his existence out of the Souls of men: and I doubt not if the <hi>Socinians</hi> had lived in those days, by this

                  </p>
                  <p>What further design <hi>Socinus</hi> himself might have, or whether he had any other design by advancing this Opinion, then the overturning that great Article of our faith concerning the satisfaction of Christ; I shall not positively determine. Only this I cannot but acquaint the Reader with, which hath bin long since observed likewise by others, that <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers in all their books and disputations, have made it their business chiefly to cavil and make exceptions to their adversaries, not careing what became of Religion, so that they might with any colour avoid the Arguments with which they were pressed, as is in some measure made evident by several passages which we have quoted out of their writings in the foregoing discourse. And I have this further to add, that as <hi>Socinus:</hi> by denying the <hi>divinity and satisfaction of Christ,</hi> hath plainly overturned the foundation upon which the Christian Church and Religion have bin built: so by this assertion about Gods justice, and by several others dispersed and sliely insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated through his writings, he hath given a shrewd blow to all Religion whatsoever, whether natural, or revealed; so that an unwary Reader, by perusing his writings, may find himself an <hi>Atheist</hi> before he well perceives how he comes to be so:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62459:28"/> as he saith in another case, <hi>viz.</hi> his Opinion aginst Hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he had so contrived the matter, <hi>ut lector prius sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat doctrinam istam sibi jam persuasam esse, quam suaderi animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertat</hi>
                     <seg rend="sup">1</seg>.</p>
                  <p>And now I should come to a conclusion of this discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods Justice, (which I have spun out to a greater length then I at first intended) But that I foresee an objection will be made against all that I have said, by the <hi>Socinians</hi> and their friends; who will be apt to say, that I have bin taking a great deal of pains to no purpose, to aggravate the mischiefs of an Opinion, which admit it were false in speculation, yet as it is stated by them, can in <hi>point of fact and practise,</hi> carry no inconvenience imaginable along with it.</p>
                  <p>For whatever God may do when left to his own liberty, yet he hath thought fit to oblige himself by positive promises and threatnings to reward the righteous and to punish the wicked: so that now by the revelation of his will he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed abridged himself of his natural liberty, but hath thereby taken effectual care to secure his own honour, and to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Religion in the world, and all this is plainly acknowledged by the <hi>Socinians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I answer, that this doth not take off the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Impiety of this <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion, which I was obliged to discover; any more then if a man should say, that God hath indeed <hi>resolved</hi> to act <hi>wisely and righteously</hi> in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World; but that neither <hi>wisdome nor righteousness are necessary and essential Attributes</hi> perpetually residing in him, but are only the effects of his free will: which were a most irreligious and profane assertion, notwithstanding the former acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>2. Tho the <hi>Socinians</hi> hereby take care of revealed, yet they overturn all natural Religion, as we shewed before, where God hath made no such Revelation of his will, or discovery of his intentions how he doth design to deal with men;<note place="bottom">Epis. 6. ad Volkel</note>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62459:29"/> and so as far as in them lies, by this principle, they help to make the <note n="1" place="bottom">See Breerwoods Enquiries, Cap. 14.</note> much greatest part of mankind Atheists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3ly,</hi> When God hath declared his purpose, and hath accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly given men Laws for the government of their actions, and hath to those Laws expresly annexed the sanctions of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishment,</hi> yet according to the <hi>Socinian principles,</hi> this doth not sufficiently encourage men in <hi>vertuous practices,</hi> nor lay an <hi>effectual restraint</hi> upon the wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> As to rewards it is true the Gospel affords us, as the Apostle tells us, exceeding great and precious promises 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. which exceed not only our <hi>deserts,</hi> but our <hi>hopes:</hi> But what absolute assurance have we that they shall be made good to us. They are only the effects as <hi>Socinus</hi> tells us <hi>Liberae,</hi> or as <hi>Vorstius</hi> explains it, <hi>vertibilis voluntatis,</hi> not only of a <hi>free,</hi> (for therein we agree with them,) but of a mutable will: for according to them, as was shewed before, God is <hi>liable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,</hi> and may <hi>change</hi> his purpose as he doth the weather, <hi>sicut potest pluere vel non pluere:</hi> but tho the Morning proves never so fair, yet the Heavens may be overcast; and the Sun that Rose so gloriously, may set in a Cloud.</p>
                  <p>In short, if we believe the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the promises of God considered barely in themselves are not a sufficient Basis for a Christians hope and security; forasmuch as God being <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Voluntas Dei est principium cujusdam mutabilitatis in Deo,</hi> Vorst. Disp. de Deo. p. 212.</note>
                     <hi>mutable in his nature,</hi> he may <hi>repent</hi> of what he promised, and <hi>change and alter</hi> his Resolution. And that the Reader may not think that I have wronged the <hi>Socinians</hi> in laying this to their charge, I must refer him to a Treatise writ by <hi>Crellius, de Causis Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Christi;</hi> where he will find this that I have affirmed of them abundantly made good. For there he tells us that the true reason of Christs dying for us, was that thereby he might be a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and surety of the <hi>Covenant</hi> which God hath made with men; for tho God had given men the promise of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their Sins, yet that promise was no <hi>sufficient security,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he might have receded or started from it: Therefore to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62459:29"/> fix him as it were to his word, Christ was sent as a sponsor and surety of the New Testament, which in the name of his Father, he did confirme and ratifye, by sealing it with his Blood; whereupon now God is <hi>obliged</hi> to make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, so that if he had a mind to revoke it he cannot, the Death of Christ <hi>compelling</hi> him to preserve it <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>Indeed he could not but be sensible, that what he had thus delivered, would sound harshly in the Ears of Most Readers, those especially who had any concern for the Honour of their Maker, which by this supposition was so highly and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously Invaded: therefore to mollify this matter he tells us, that the efficacy which he ascribes to Christs Death, was not absolutely necessary in respect of God; whose own Love, Grace and Mercy, might <hi>move and encline him</hi> to make good his promise; yet however this put him under no <hi>obligation;</hi> for if it had, there had bin no need of the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> either in <hi>respect of God, or our selves,</hi> either to have tyed him to the performance, or to have afforded us security.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he tells us <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Nam ut nos tanto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius credere possemus, nobis in Christum credentibus peccata remissum iri, plurimum referebat Deum ad id faciendum</hi> obligatum <hi>esse, &amp; nos jus ad illud obtinendum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere; jus inquam manifestissimis ac certissimis documentis nixum, quod jam quicquid tandem interveniret, Deum non pateretur promissa sua rescindere,</hi> Ibid.</note>, that we might have a firme bottome for our hope, that if we believed in Christ, that is, obeyed his Gospel, our sins should be forgiven us; it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us that God should be <hi>obliged</hi> to performe what he had promised; and not only so, but that we might acquire a <hi>Right</hi> to pardon; which right he founds not in the <hi>promise of God</hi> but the Death of Christ, which he saith gives us such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Title to Mercy, and that supported by such a firme and manifest assurance and proof, as will not suffer God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may happen, to <hi>break his word,</hi> and <hi>recall his promise.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62459:30"/> this he tells us was the true reason of Christs coming into the world, and of Gods delivering him up to death for our sakes.</p>
                  <p>By all which it is evident, that in the Opinion of this man, the <hi>promises</hi> of God considered nakedly in themselves, do not afford us a <hi>sufficient security;</hi> forasmuch as something may intervene; which may cause God to <hi>repent</hi> of what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and thereby hinder the performance: and that you may not think that he had <hi>forgot himself,</hi> by making an <hi>impious or impossible supposition,</hi> he tells us, <hi>utimur phrasi sacris literis usitata;</hi> that they used a phrase which was frequently made use of in the Scripture it selfe, which often mentions Gods sorrow and repentance, and therefore it can be no disparagement to all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to ascribe it to him, it being rather in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion an argument of his wisdome, as was shewed before.</p>
                  <p>I must indeed acknowledge that this very Author at another time, <hi>Lib. de Deo. Cap. 25. de Sancti Dei. p.</hi> 241. affirms that the promises of God put him under an obligation, and that both his veracity and faithfulness engages him to make them good. But it is as evident on the other hand, that here he <hi>supposes the contrary,</hi> and that his Argument proceeds upon that <hi>supposition.</hi> But by this time I hope the Reader will not be much surprised to find Socinians <hi>contradicting themselves,</hi> and he need not be concerned at it; for I can assure him, whether he will or no, they will take the liberty of so doing. And hereby we find the observation which we a little before made concerning them, confirmed; <hi>viz.</hi> that in their disputations and writings they care not what they say, having no regard to the honour of God or Religion; being only concerned for their own reputation, and to defend and maintain their own <hi>loose and unwarrantable Opinions.</hi>

                     <hi>2ly,</hi> But let us admit that God by his <hi>promises</hi> puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe under an obligation to men, so that he cannot go from his word, but is obliged to make it good; yet he may be at <hi>greater liberty</hi> as to his <hi>threatnings.</hi> Indeed these as the Gospel represents them to us are verry terrible, whether we consider the punishments threatned either as to their <hi>Intensive pain,</hi> or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62459:30"/> as to the <hi>extent of their duration;</hi> for we are told that <hi>the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed shall go into everlasting punishment; that the worme that gnaws their Conscience shall not dye, and the fire that torments them shall never be extinguished.</hi> This is indeed enough to make the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner look pale, and to fright him either out <hi>of his wits,</hi> or out of his <hi>wicked course of living.</hi> But for all this he need not despair of Mercy; for tho God hath <hi>threatned severely,</hi> yet no man living can absolutely tell us, if we believe <hi>Socinus,</hi> whether he is resolved to <hi>execute his threatnings. For as at first God might either not have punished the Sinner at all, or not with eternal death, so now tho he hath declared by his solemn Edict that he will do so, yet for all that he may if he pleases not inflict the punishment.</hi> Deus potuisset, idque jure, homines licet peccantes morti aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae non mancipare, sic postquam eos morti aeternae Edicto suo mancipavit, ex illius imperio eximere potest. <hi>Socin. de Christo Serv. Lib. 1. p.</hi> 124.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eximere potest,</hi> saith Socinus, <hi>he may exempt the Sinner</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his <hi>Decree</hi> of punishing him; and why may not he hope that <hi>he will:</hi> the <hi>bare threatnings</hi> according to <hi>Socinus</hi> do not <hi>oblige</hi> God to execute them: and the consideration of Gods Mercy and Justice, to which the Torments of Hell as he may imagin can scarce be reconciled, may upon that score afford him some ground <hi>to hope</hi> that he doth not <hi>design to do so.</hi> We know sinners are apt to allow themselves, as too great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in sinning, so to flatter themselves with too great hopes of Impunity; and if they meet with any such compassionate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists as <hi>Socinus,</hi> who will afford they any encouragement, they are presently apt to run away with it, and never look back, to see that <hi>vengeance</hi> which pursues, and will at length cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly over take them.</p>
                  <p>But how comes this man to know any thing of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what he hath revealed of himself in his word: must we have recourse to that exploded distinction of the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and for which they have bin so much railed at by their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, concerning the <hi>revealed, and the secret will of God:</hi> for tho the question in the case may seeme to be about the <hi>power</hi> of God, yet really and in truth it is about <hi>his will;</hi> forasmuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62459:31"/> as God <hi>cannot do</hi> what he hath solemnly declared he <hi>will not do;</hi> and that for this <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>irrefragable reason,</hi> because God cannot deny himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And now have we not reason to put the question, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether went the Spirit of God from the <hi>Inspired writers,</hi> to rest upon the head of this <hi>Impostor,</hi> who makes his <hi>excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to what they have declared as the <hi>peremtory and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able decree of God.</hi> Nay who boldly ventures to affirme that, which <hi>Balaam</hi> could not be <hi>hired</hi> to utter, tho <hi>tempted to it by the wages of unrighteousness;</hi> but makes that pious acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Numb. 23. God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? hath he spoken, and shall be not make it good?</hi> Now if it be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for God to lie,</hi> then it is not possible for him to alter the sentence concerning the final state of men; which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scripture in such termes, as plainly evince it to be his <hi>peremptory and irrevocable decree:</hi> The happiness of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and punishments of the wicked, as to the <hi>extent of their duration,</hi> being expressed in the same words, and in the same sentence: and if it be possible to know any thing of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> and <hi>Immutable pleasure</hi> of God; the <hi>wit</hi> of man could not contrive any plainer words, then what the <hi>wisdome of God</hi> hath allready made use of, to declare his final and unalterable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, concerning the everlasting punishment of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Besides it deserves to be considered, that this Declaration is not only delivered in the manner of a <hi>threatning,</hi> but likewise by way of <hi>prediction,</hi> in the fullfiling of which, the veracity of God may seeme to be more particularly concerned, then in the execution of a bare Threatning delivered in a Sermon, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, or the like. Now in those <hi>glorious visions</hi> which were communicated to St. <hi>John</hi> which he stiles <hi>the word of God, the Testimony and Revelation of Jesus Christ, concerning the things which were, and which should be hereafter,</hi> Rev. 1. v. 1, 2, 19. which are styled the <hi>true sayings of God,</hi> ch. 19. v. 9. <hi>the words that are faithful and true</hi> ch. 21. v. 5. I say in these visions are conteined, as the state and events of the Church till the final dissolution of all things; so likewise the condition and fate of the Righteous and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62459:31"/> Wicked, after the judgement of the last day. <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. 21 he tells us that he <hi>saw the dead, both small and great, stand before God, and they were all judged according to their works, and whoever was not found written in the Book of Life, was cast into the Lake of fire,</hi> ver. 15. called ver. 10. <hi>the lake of fire and brimstone, where the Devil, and the Beast, and the false Prophet shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what is said in general of the wicked, we are assured shall betide the <hi>fearful, and unbelievers, and the abominable and murderers, and forcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, who shall have their part in that lake, which burneth with fire and brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21. 8. this is that furnace of fire which our blessed Saviour so often mentioneth, Mat. 13. 42. 50. <hi>that everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 41. <hi>That fire,</hi> which agin and again he assures us Mark. 9. <hi>shall not be quenched,</hi> no less then five times within the compass of Six, <hi>verses</hi> 43, 44, 45, 46, 48. to declare unto us by this Repetition, the certainty of this thing, as in the case of <hi>Pharohs</hi> Dream, which was doubled to assure him that the <hi>thing was established by God.</hi> Gen. 41. 32.</p>
                  <p>The wit of man could not find out words more full and significant, to express the <hi>eternal duration</hi> of these punishments, and Gods <hi>unalterable purpose</hi> to inflict them. Now to say, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, that yet in the conclusion, things may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be otherwise then what the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath declared, and this <hi>servant of God</hi> hath foretold, is with great boldness to contradict them both: and if it be <hi>possible</hi> that these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions may not be accomplished, then the words are not <hi>faithful and true,</hi> that is, are not undoubtedly and absolutely true: so that at the same time, that <hi>Socinus</hi> puts an end to the <hi>certainty</hi> of Hell Torments, he doth likewise put an end to the <hi>certainty</hi> of the writings of the New Testament, and the <hi>predictions</hi> that are conteined there: which is highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Authority of those sacred Writings, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the Revelation of St. <hi>John;</hi> which looks too much like the <hi>taking away from the words of the Prophecy of that Book;</hi> which yet I hope it is not, because of that dreadful punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which attends those that do so, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 19. In short, if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62459:32"/> things <hi>may happen</hi> otherwise then St. <hi>John</hi> foresaw and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, some Scepticks and Infidels, which the age we live in doth too much abound with, may be apt to account that a <hi>dream,</hi> which he calls a <hi>vision;</hi> and to think, the holy man was <hi>scarce awake</hi> when he pretended to <hi>foresee</hi> these things.</p>
                  <p>Neither ought the case of <hi>Temporal threatnings</hi> be objected here in favour of <hi>Socinus's</hi> assertion: forasmuch as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath told us, that in all such <hi>Threatenings,</hi> a condition is to be <hi>supposed,</hi> tho it be not allways <hi>expressed;</hi> so that tho they are delivered in termes <hi>seemingly absolute,</hi> yet God without any impeachment of his <hi>veracity,</hi> may upon the performance of the condition <hi>revoke them. At what instant,</hi> saith God, <hi>I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the Evil, that I thought to do unto them,</hi> Jer. 18. 7. 8. and this was the case of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> where tho the threatening was seemingly peremtory, yet the execution was suspended upon their <hi>Repentance,</hi> which was the <hi>end</hi> of the threatening.</p>
                  <p>But as to the punishments of the life to come, the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them must be <hi>absolute and unconditional,</hi> forasmuch as there can then be no roome for <hi>Repentance and amendment:</hi> every mans state will then be finally determined: <hi>he that is filthy will be filthy still,</hi> without any possibility of change, or hope of pardon: and this is that which fills up the measure of the punishment of the damned: he that sinned without the <hi>fear of God</hi> in this life, shall be punished <hi>without Mercy</hi> in the next; and this dispair will be that worme which will seed upon him to all eternity, which shall ever torment, but never devour the sinner, who will then become a terror to himself and an evelasting amazement.</p>
                  <p>In short therefore, and to summe up all that remains to be said upon this subject; he that goes about to <hi>weaken the force</hi> of those declarations which God hath made concerning the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal punishment</hi> of the wicked, gives a <hi>dangerous blow</hi> to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, of which we can have no <hi>certainty,</hi> if once we undermine the <hi>veracity of God,</hi> which is the <hi>foundation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62459:32"/> which it is built, and by which it is supported. But you will say the hopes which <hi>Socinus</hi> gives the sinner are but very slender, and those remote ones, which no man in point of prudence or safety should venture to rely upon. I confess I think so too: but for all this sinners will be bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtuous: and you cannot wonder that men should grasp at any thing; lay hold upon any the <hi>weakest twig,</hi> rather then <hi>sink</hi> into Hell. But if this be not enough, <hi>Socinus</hi> can give the sinner more positive and direct encouragement; such as will not only put an end to the <hi>Torments of Hell,</hi> but likewise to his own <hi>vain and superstitious fears</hi> concerning them, and will <hi>extinguish</hi> those flames, which our blessed Saviour (who one would think should best know) hath assured us are <hi>unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> but of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now if what hath bin hitherto said is not sufficient to shew the <hi>impiety and detestableness</hi> of these <hi>Socinian</hi> notions, he that will be at the pains to peruse their writings, or will but have the patience to read what is here transcribed out of them, will find (if it were possible) yet greater abominations then these: particularly in the account which they give of those <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> which they ascribe to God, and with which indeed the Scriptures represent him to us, but in a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent sense then they are understood and interpreted by the <hi>Socinians;</hi> who give us such a description of Allmighty God as is <hi>repugnant to piety,</hi> and to the <hi>general sentiments,</hi> not only of all sound Christians, but even of Jews, and manysober hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who have had <hi>truer</hi> and <hi>more honourable</hi> conceptions of the nature of God, then these men furnish us with; who cloath him with all the <hi>passions and weaknesses of men,</hi> ascribing to him <hi>love and hatred, mercy and compassion, hope and desire, joy and sorrow, fear and repentance,</hi> which they make to be <hi>truly and properly</hi> in God, tho not exactly in the same manner as they are in men, no more then they are in other created spirits, or the Soul of man it self in its state of separation from the Body: that is, they are there, but without any motion, or <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible alteration</hi> of the <hi>Blood and Spirits,</hi> such as is to be found in men. But our Religion and right reason will inform us,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62459:33"/> that these things are attributed to God, but it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>For first he makes these affections to be acts, or as <hi>Crellius</hi> calls them commotions of Gods will, which some have thought could not be properly ascribed to him, without overthrowing the <hi>simplicity</hi> as well as <hi>immutability</hi> of his divine nature.

                  <p>So with the same truth, and for the same reason it should be averred, when <hi>human passions</hi> are ascribed to God, it is not by reason of any <hi>resemblance</hi> that is between God and Men in <hi>these affections;</hi> but by reason of that <hi>Analogy or similitude</hi> that is to be found between the <hi>operations of God,</hi> and these <hi>actions</hi> of men; which <hi>in them</hi> arise from such <hi>commotions</hi> of the Soul which we call passions, but <hi>in God</hi> proceeds from his <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and uncompounded nature,</hi> who is Infinite and unchangable, and therefore as our Church in conformity to the Scriptures hath taught us to believe, <hi>is without parts and without passions.

                  <p>Lastly, for that sort of <hi>Grief</hi> which respects things past, which we call <hi>Repentance,</hi> this likewise is to be found in God: and not that only which signifies the <hi>alteration of his Counsels,</hi> or a change of his will, of which we have spoken before; which may indeed be called Repentance, but that saith <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> is <hi>dilutior Metaphora</hi>

                  <p>And thus much shall serve to be said upon the first head, concerning the nature of God considered absolutely in himself, and his divine attributes; by which we may see the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> say, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> affirme of him: and I doubt not but the pious Reader, will not only be <hi>offended,</hi> but struck with a <hi>just horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> at the boldness and impiety of these blasphemers, who are thus injurious to their maker, and think and speak thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably of him. But how little regard, and how mean so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their <hi>conceptions</hi> be of God, yet they have a <hi>good opinion</hi> of themselves; in that they make not only their <hi>reason</hi> to be the <hi>adaequate Judge</hi> of his revelations, but even their own <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and weakness, the rule</hi> by which they measure, at least make an estimate of his <hi>infinite nature</hi> and most <hi>adorable perfections;</hi> an attempt, besides the impiety of it, more ridiculous, then if a man should endeavour to take the dimensions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with a single span, or to fathome the depth and reach the bottome of the Ocean with his little finger.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we must consider God <hi>Relatively</hi> in the great mystery of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And that which the Scriptures teach us to believe of this matter, is briefly summed up in the first Article of our Religion established in this Church concerning faith in the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> in these words; <hi>In the unity of the Godhead there be three persons, of one substance, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Eternity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> Or as it is with some alteration of words, but to the same purpose expressed, in the Doxology to be repeated upon Trinity Sunday; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are taught to make this acknowledgement of Allmighty God, <hi>That he is one God, one Lord, not one only person, but three persons in one substance; for that which we believe of the Glory of the Father, the same we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, without any difference or inequality.</hi> A breif but <hi>comprehensive</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, of what is more largely declared and explained, in the Creed, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Remonstrants</hi> have so great a spight against, commonly called the <hi>Athanasian Creed.</hi>

                  <p>This is the Faith of all the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> being herein Agreeable to the doctrine held by the Church of God in all Ages, ever since the first planting of Christianity in the world; what we and they believe of this matter, being conformable to the plain and express declarations of Scripture, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of what Christ and his Apostles have delivered to us concerning this matter, in the writings of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> For this you may consult the <hi>Harmony of their Confessions;</hi> both <hi>Lutheran and Calvinist</hi> all exactly agreeing in this doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least difference or variety: where you may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise see the consent of the Catholick Church from the first Ages next to that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> from whose inspired <hi>writings</hi> the Fathers received this Doctrine, which by an <hi>uninterrupted Tradition,</hi> thro all the successive Ages of the Church, hath bin delivered and brought down to the times we live in: In this Faith we have all bin <hi>baptized,</hi> being at our first admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Christian Church, solemnly <hi>consecrated</hi> to the worship and service of those three ever blessed and glorious persons, <hi>Father, Son and Holy Ghost Mat.</hi> 28. These being the three that bear witness in Heaven, and these three are one, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>For that Text we shall not easily part with, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cavils of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and the <hi>over officious endeavors</hi> of some others, whether <hi>Papists or Protestants,</hi> who would weaken the Authority of that Testimony, and thereby rob us of the advantage of it. For tho some Greek MSS. want it, yet there are others more approved and of greater antiquity in which you may meet with it. Besides it is to be found in the writings of the Ancients, <hi>Tertull. Cypr. Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> who quote these very words: and if you have a mind to know more of this matter, without going any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may peruse what Mr. <hi>Poole</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis</hi> hath quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Gerhard,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> and other Writers in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Text.</p>
                  <p>From which I think it will appear, that the <hi>Authority</hi> of this place remains clear and in full force, notwithstanding the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that have bin made to overthrow it. Tho if we gave up this Text, yet we should not the holy Doctrine contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62459:39"/> in it, which is so plainly delivered in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and shines there with so <hi>bright a lustre,</hi> that a man had need wink hard, who would avoid the conviction; or else must have so great a confidence in his Eyes, that he may hope in time to stare the Sun it self out of countenance.</p>
                  <p>For as in some places of Scripture he will find the <hi>unity of the Godhead</hi> asserted; so in others he will find the name, and not only so, but to avoid any Cavils and exceptions that may be made about the ambiguous signification of that word: he will find the <hi>same divine Attributes, and Operations,</hi> on all hands acknowledged to belong to God the Father, ascribed likewise to the Son and the Holy Ghost; who yet are allwaies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as distinct from one another: from whence by an easie and a <hi>necessary deduction,</hi> it must unavoidably follow, that since they are <hi>really distinguished</hi> from each other, and yet agree in the same <hi>common nature,</hi> as the <hi>same properties</hi> and the same <hi>operations,</hi> irrefragably evince; they must be, what we have bin taught hitherto to believe and profess of them, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Church, three Persons and one God. And as we pretend to agree in the same doctrine with the Ancient Church, so I think it is highly sitting, and for many just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in a manner necessary, to preserve the same words in which it hath bin delivered down to us, in opposition to any new modes of speaking. For the Ancient words by <hi>prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and long use, have obtained both a <hi>just Authority</hi> among Christians, and a <hi>setled and determinate signification:</hi> whereas new phrases may be liable to great exceptions, and introductive at long run of new and unwarrantable opinions about these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; beyond the intention of them who first made use of them.</p>
                  <p>Now against all this the <hi>Socinians</hi> will tell you, that this doctrine concerning the Trinity is so far from being a <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truth,</hi> that it is indeed the <hi>foundation</hi> of all the errors that have crept into the Christian Church; as being opposite to the Scriptures, and plainly repugnant to reason: it is a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish doctrine,</hi> so saith <hi>Socinus</hi> Lib. <hi>quod Regni Polon.</hi> &amp;c. cap. 4. so <hi>Welsing. Lib. de Offic. Hominis Christiani,</hi> and by so saying they do
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62459:40"/> exceedingly advance the Reputation of Popery, by makeing it of so great and venerable antiquity, embraced by all sound Christians ever since the Apostles days. It is a <hi>Paganish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Ethnicisnum sapit,</hi> so saith <hi>Smalcius, Exam. Cent. Err</hi> So opposite to reason, that it is a wonder how any man in his wits could ever have thought of it.

Strange that that doctrine should be thought a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to mens happiness, the belief of which by all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians hath hitherto bin thought necessary to salvation: but so it is if you believe <hi>Socinus, Lib. supra cit. eodem cap.</hi>

                     <hi>2ly,</hi> Concerning the Spirit of God; they tell us that he is not a Person, as the Church of God hath hitherto vainly imagined: but only a quality, an accident; sometimes taken for the <hi>Innate power</hi> and vertue residing in God, and sometimes for the <hi>operations</hi> that proceed from that vertue and faculty <note n="3" place="bottom">Vid.

                     </note>. <hi>Crellius</hi> hath written a particular Treatise <hi>de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> and therein he tells us that the word spirit, in its first and proper signification, denotes <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Flatum ex ore Animalis expression.</hi> p. 455.</note> that breath which is expired out of the mouths of Men or other Animals; and from the <hi>resemblance</hi> that is to be found between them, it is transferred to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that divine vertue in God which we call the Holy Ghost: and therefore when Christ <hi>Jo.</hi> 20. 22. breathed on his Disciples, and thereby conferred upon them the Holy Ghost; <note n="5" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicavit Spiritum Sanctum ejusgue à Deo &amp; Christo Emanationem seu Emissionem, afflatui sive spiraculo esse similem,</hi> Proleg. de Spiritu Sancto <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> he did thereby give them to understand, that the holy spirit was an <hi>Emanation from God, not unlike a vapour or breathing.</hi> At this rate the Holy Ghost should it seemes be a subtile and tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious substance, contrary to what he asserts <hi>cap.</hi> 1. where he plainly tells us that the Spirit of God is not properly <hi>a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> but <hi>a quality,</hi> therefore called in the Scripture the power of the most High, <hi>&amp; virtus proprié qualitas est,</hi> p. 466.</p>
                  <p>But forasmuch as many things, by his own acknowledgment, are affirmed of, and actions ascribed to the Holy Ghost, which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62459:41"/> cannot well agree to qualities, but must suppose the thing to which they are ascribed to be a substance; such as are <hi>Local motion, Bodily shape, division and the like:</hi> to reconcile therefore these seeming differences he is of Opinion, that the Spirit of God consider'd abstractedly in it self, is a meere quality; but yet this vertue may be impressed upon, and conveighed into some subtile and coelestial matter, <hi>&amp; ejus naturae valde congruae,</hi> which is agreeable to its nature, <hi>Ibid.</hi> As we find the vital energy of the Soul communicated first to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So saith he, by the Spirit of God is sometimes meant that <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Materia subtilis, quae qualitatem divinam in se habet, &amp; per quam in hominum pectora deferri solet.</hi> Ibid. p. 467.</note> tenuious matter which conteins a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine quality in it, and by which it is conveighed into the minds of men: and in this sense he conceives the spirit of God, may be called a <hi>Corporeal substance,</hi> which hath extension, and is capable of division, as other Bodies tho spiritual are <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Isto modo Spiritum Sanctum substantiam quandam esse, eamqne corpoream non est negandum,</hi> Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And by this notion he thinks he hath found out an easy way, to solve the former difficulties concerning the <hi>Local mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Holy Ghost, and particularly, his descent upon our Saviour at the time of his Baptisme, and upon the Apostles in the <hi>days of Pentecost.</hi> Of his being poured out, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, sometimes in measure, and sometimes without it: of his being divided and distributed and the like: which tho we interpret of the <hi>gifts,</hi> he doth of the <hi>nature and essence of the Holy Ghost,</hi> which according to this account he gives of it, may like other <hi>Steams and vapors</hi> be carry'd here and there, and may be divided and distributed in greater and lesser quantities as there is occasion. And thus God took some part of this <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial matter,</hi> which conteined that divine vertue with which <hi>Moses</hi> was endued, and put it into the 70 Elders <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62459:41"/> and in the same sense <hi>Elisha</hi> had <hi>a double portion</hi> of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Elias,</hi> that is, of that divine <hi>steame and vapor</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to do wonders.</p>
                  <p>Now if we shall further enquire what that Coelestial matter is, by which this divine quality which he makes to be the Holy Ghost, is conveighed and distributed among men; he hath not determined, but hath left it to the Readers discretion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture: tho he hath given sufficient intimation how he would have him govern his Opinion. For in the other instances which he produces, the <hi>quality</hi> and the <hi>effluviums,</hi> proceed from the same <hi>subject;</hi> and he gives you no limitation, no caution in the least to think otherwise in this case: it is plain that some of his friends as he tells us, were of that Opinion, that the Spirit of God, was nothing but an <hi>Emanation, a tenuious steame flowing from the very substance of God,</hi> as the breath doth out of our mouths and nostrils <note n="1" place="bottom">Crell.

                     </note>: <hi>quam sententiam,</hi> saith he, <hi>in medio relinquimus;</hi> he will not give you his Opinion in this case, it being but fit that in <hi>matters of Religion,</hi> every man should be left to his own freedome, and therefore he fairly leaves you to your own.

                  <p>And by this explication of the nature of a spirit, <hi>Crellius</hi> who calls God a spirit, and <hi>Socinus</hi> who plainly thought he was none, (as appears by his <note n="2" place="bottom">Vid.

Because God at present saith he, is seen by the Angels, and shall be so hereafter by us, with our Bodily Eies; and therefore not Infinite. For what is so cannot be comprehended by any sense, as he rightly upon this supposition argues: <hi>Quia debet esse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio inter objectum percipiendum, &amp; personam percipientem:</hi> and whereas it may be objected that the <hi>Beatifick vision</hi> respects the <hi>inward speculation</hi> of the mind, and not the <hi>external perception</hi> of the Eies; some indeed so interpret it saith he, <hi>Sed nescio an sacris literis consentaneum sit; certe magnam futurae nostrae foelicitatis partem hac explicatione tollere videntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if God be finite, it must further follow, and is plainly acknowledged by these men, <hi>that magnitude and extension, and a true local presence</hi> may and must be ascribed to God: and this is so far from being by them looked upon to be derogatory to the nature and perfection of God; that the contrary notion is scouted by them, not only as false, but as absurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which asserts such a presence of God, as obliges us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him not be confined to any certain place, neither to have any parts commensurate to the parts of that place in which he is. For this if any thing must be the meaning of <note n="1" place="bottom">Exam. Censurae in Conf. Rem. Cap. 2. p. 43.</note>

                  <p>And now at length we see what a blessed notion of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God the <hi>Socinians</hi> have furnished us with; how <hi>scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> and <hi>dishonourable</hi> to God, how <hi>repugnant to piety,</hi> how opposite to <hi>right reason,</hi> and to those sober and just apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which <hi>that</hi> hath furnished many wise heathens with, who I am afraid may one day rise up in Judgement against these men and condemn them.</p>
                  <p>It may be now time to draw towards a conclusion of this Discourse, therefore I shall briefly summe up what hath been said upon this subject: that the Readers memory may be refreshed with the account which hath bin given him, both of what the Scripture affirme of God, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> say of him.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures have informed us that our God is <hi>Infinite,</hi> they say he is <hi>Finite,</hi> ours is <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> theirs <hi>Limited</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a certain place: ours <hi>Immutable,</hi> theirs <hi>Liable to change;</hi> ours is <hi>naturaly just,</hi> theirs <hi>contingently</hi> so: ours <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily</hi> concerned in the government of the World, and taking care of humane affairs; theirs might, like <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Deity, sit at ease in the enjoyment of his own happyness, leaving the world to the <hi>conduct of chance;</hi> and men to the <hi>guidance</hi> of that which is <hi>equally uncertain,</hi> their own giddy and unstable passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; neither giving them <hi>Laws</hi> for the regulating of their actions, nor assigning any <hi>punishments</hi> to the violation of them. Our God is <hi>Omniscient,</hi> theirs <hi>ignorant of future and contingent events:</hi> ours <hi>without parts or passions,</hi> theirs <hi>compounded of one,</hi> and <hi>lyable</hi> to the other; even to those which argue the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est weakness and infirmity, and which some of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers thought inconsistent, with the bravery and resolution, of a wise and virtuous man. In short, our God consists of three blessed and glorious persons, subsisting in the same undivided essence: They deny the divine nature of the Son, and yet by an unpardonable contradiction, say that he is <hi>a true God;</hi> and disown the personality of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>From all which I think it will appear very evident, what
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62459:44"/> we undertook to make out at the beginning of this discourse, that the <hi>Object</hi> of their Religion and ours is different; and that will go a great way to prove that the <hi>Religions themselves</hi> are so too. In short, the difference between us is not so small as some <hi>ignorant</hi> people may <hi>imagine,</hi> and some <hi>crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing persons may pretend;</hi> among whom I cannot but reckon <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> who most falsely and impudently against common <hi>sense and reason,</hi> and therefore one might be tempted to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, against <hi>his Conscience;</hi> would perswade the world to believe, that the difference between us and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in the point of the Divinity of the son of God, was a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <hi>about words</hi> rather then any <hi>reall difference,</hi> in a matter of faith: which is quite contrary to the notion that either the Orthodox or the <hi>Socinians</hi> have of this matter: who lay a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and truer stress upon their Opinions, then this man doth, who pretends to bless the world with a discovery of what no body ever knew before.</p>
                  <p>But I believe the Reader who hath perused the foregoing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, will be induced to believe that either the <hi>Socinians</hi> or we are in a very great mistake, the distance between us being wider then that between <hi>Heaven and Earth:</hi> and indeed no less then between <hi>Finite and Infinite.</hi> So that upon a true state of things, I believe it will be found that our Opinions are not only seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>inconsistent,</hi> but absolutely <hi>irreconcileable;</hi> forasmuch as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reconcile them, we must part with the <hi>Infinite nature</hi> of God the Father, and the Divinity of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And surely that man must be very <hi>fond,</hi> nay he must be <hi>mad</hi> for peace, that can be content, to sacrifice both <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>the Divine Author</hi> of it, in order to purchase it. Once indeed our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour came down among men, and <hi>offered up himself</hi> upon the Cross in order to <hi>reconcile the two greatest Enemies,</hi> God and Man: but it is too much in all Conscience which is expected of us, that we should make <hi>a new Oblation of our Saviour:</hi> and not only as the Jews
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62459:45"/> did, nail his Body to the Cross, but <hi>sacrifice even his Divinity,</hi> to compose the differences in Religion.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps some may say the <hi>Socinians</hi> are men of more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> then to desire us presently to part with all our Religion to gratifie them: They only plead <hi>for liberty,</hi> and in order to their joyning with us, that we would remove those <hi>obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Articles, Creeds, Confessions of Faith,</hi> some <hi>useless expressions</hi> in our Common Prayer, which contein too plain and <hi>uncharitable</hi> acknowledgments of the Trinity; which hinder many pious, useful and excellent persons from coming to our Churches. Why should we not strip our Faith of all those larger and unwarrantable explications which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Fathers have made of it; and reduce all to the <hi>naked expressions</hi> of Scripture: that is, content our selves with a few Ambiguous words, (which the perverse and subtile Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Hereticks have made so) and let every man abound in his own sense.</p>
                  <p>They believe Christ to be the Son of God, so as to be true God likewise: what need we trouble our selves or them with the word <hi>Consubstantial;</hi> pity it is, that a word, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ay a <hi>Letter</hi> should divide men in their Opinions and Affections. To all which, tho I have a great deal that I could answer, yet at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent all that I shall say shall be this: That the <hi>Socinians</hi> are <hi>wise</hi> men, persons of a deep reach; but they must not think that all the rest of the World <hi>are fooles.</hi> It were too much in all Conscience to desire us to part with all at first: but they know what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to make of our Concessions: if they can perswade us with that foolish woman <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 1. to pull down our house with our own hands, it will save them the toyl and drudgery of so doing: at least if they can prevail with us to demolish our <hi>Outworks,</hi> then they will be able as with greater ease, so likewise with greater hopes of success, to <hi>Attack the main Fort.</hi> In short, the <hi>Ancient Creeds and Confessions,</hi> and those <hi>Ancient words</hi> in which the Doctrine of Faith hath bin conveyed down to us; are only <note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Sherlocks Apol.</note> a <hi>Hedge of Thornes,</hi> as they have bin truely and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently styled, with which the Christian Faith hath bin guarded

                  <p>And thus much shall serve to be said upon the first Head, of the great difference there is, between what the Scriptures affirme, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> say of the great object of our Religion God Allmighty. And if there were only this in the case, I hope it might prove sufficient to guard any pious well meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, from the <hi>Infection</hi> of their Impious Opinions, which furnish him with notions, so <hi>dishohonrable</hi> and injurious to his maker: and who by denying the blessed Trinity, and the Divinity of our Saviour, have subverted the very foundations of Christianity, altered the whole Oeconomy of mans Salvation: so that they and we must go different waies to Heaven, as having neither the same meanes of Grace, nor the same hopes of Glory.</p>
                  <p>I should now proceede to shew the Opposition between the <hi>Socinian</hi> tenets, and the other parts of the Christian Doctrine, which are thereby contradicted, and overthrown. But this must be referred till a time of further and better leasure: But by this Taste which I have given the Reader of <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> I may have reason to hope that he will be of the Opinion, that Religion is like Wine, the older, the more excellent and desireable. And therefore that no man of <hi>wisdome,</hi> or indeed of <hi>common sense,</hi> who hath not <hi>lost all Relish of divine things,</hi> when he hath tasted of the old Religion, will straightly desire the New, because he will find that the Old is much better.</p>
                  <closer>Now to the Holy, Blessed and undivided Trinity, three Persons and one God, be all Honour, Glory, and Praise both now and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>HAVING in my former discourse, shewed how plainly the Socinian Doctrines concerning God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered either <hi>Absolutely</hi> in himself, or <hi>Relatively</hi> in the Great mystery of the Blessed Trinity, contradict the Account which the Scriptures give us of those matters: I come now to consider the <hi>Opposition</hi> between them, and the other parts of our Holy Faith; That I may make good my charge against <hi>Socinus,</hi> in averring, that by making those great and dangerous Alterations in the Christian Doctrine, he hath been the Author and Founder, rather of a <hi>new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> then of a <hi>new name and Sect</hi> among Christians: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Just judgment of Almighty God, fallen from one error to another, untill at length he fairly <hi>shook hands</hi> with Christianity, and, as it is to be feared, at the same time <hi>took his leave</hi> of all Religion, whether natural, or Revealed: as may be shrewdly suspected from many loose and pernicious asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cunningly insinuated, and dispersed throughout his writings.</p>
                  <p>And here the first thing that I am to consider, is the State and Condition of man, before, and after his Fall: This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62459:49"/> antecedent both in order of time and nature, to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Recovery; and therefore requisite to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of, before we can come to shew the <hi>Fundamental</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which by their dangerous Innovations, <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers have made in the doctrine of our Salvation by Christ, which is the summe and substance of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore with the <hi>Creation</hi> of man. Here we must take our first Rise, as the Scripture doth, and where <hi>Socinus</hi> likewise begins his Errors. But tho he begins, he doth not end here: for as if he had raised an <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> after our Religion, he pursues it throughout the Bible, from the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to the last of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the account which the Scriptures give us of man, from his first <hi>Coming</hi> into the World, till his last <hi>Going</hi> out of it; that is, from the Creation, till the final dissolution of all things. <hi>Socinus</hi> was a wise man, and therefore was resolved not to do his work by halves: <hi>primus ad extremum similis sibi.</hi> He knew where his <hi>predecessors</hi> were wanting, and he was now able and willing to correct their mistakes. For when he hath entirely vanquished the Christian Religion, then he may hope upon the Ruins of it, the more easily, and the more securely to establish his own.</p>
                  <p>First then, if we consider the Condition of man before his fall; the account which the Scriptures give us of it is this. That after God by his mighty and powerful word had spoke all things out of nothing; having Created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, and furnished them with all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections suitable to their respective natures: Having I say, thus finished this Glorious Fabrick, he now thinks of a fit Inhabitant to be introduced into it. For sure it cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be imagined, that so magnificent a structure furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every thing that might serve either for use or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; was made either to no purpose, or for the service of some mean and contemptible Inhabitant. As therefore it was provided with all the ornaments and perfections which became so great a Palace: So God provided a suitable guest, of equal state and majesty, accomplished with all the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62459:49"/> of body and mind, that might qualifie him to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the admirable contrivance of the Creation, and to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the praises of the alwise and powerful Creator. And therefore to put as it were his <hi>last finishing</hi>

And therefore it is to be observed, that when God comes to forme man, he alters his style and language; for whereas before he only made use of his <hi>Authority,</hi> here he calls in as it were the assistance of his <hi>wisdom:</hi> he did but <hi>speak the word,</hi> and the rest of the works of his hands were made. His mighty voice not only commands things that are, but even things that are not: Confusion and emptyness submit to his authority; he brings fullness out of the one, and order and beauty out of the other; and at his single nod the visible world appears out of its state of non-existence. It was but saying, <hi>Let there be Light and there was Light; let there be a Firmament to divide the waters, and let the dry land appear and it was so,</hi> 1 Gen, 3. 6. 9. But when he comes to make man, he alters his style, <hi>Let us make man in our own Image, and after our own likeness,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. he proceeds, if I may so say, with greater care, and calls as it were a consultation of the blessed Trinity, being now to make a Creature who was to be as it were an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole Creation; all the excellencies that were <hi>divided and scattered</hi> in the other Creatures, were to be <hi>collected</hi> as it were into one Mass, and put into him, who was himself to be a kind of <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>Now if we farther enquire wherein this <hi>Image of God,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which man was made, consisted. <hi>I Ans.</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted <hi>chiefly and principally</hi> in that original Righteousness, which did perfect and adorn his Soul: not excluding that Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with which God entrusted him, which was indeed a Ray of Gods soveraign Authority, but was founded in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in that <hi>Righteousness</hi> now mentioned, and necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it: as is in part acknowledged by our Adversaries, and shall hereafter be made farther to Appear.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Righteousness</hi> which we say made up the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the <hi>Image of God</hi> in the Soul of man, was its self composed of all those qualities, which are the ornaments and perfections of the several faculties of it: such as are wisdom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62459:50"/> and knowledge in the understanding: Holyness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the will: submission, order, and regularity in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: and in short, in that happy and entire harmony which was in the Soul, arising from that uniformity and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which there was between all the powers and faculties of it▪ And thus man after he dropped out of the hands of his maker, was beheld by him with delight and complacencie, and as a mark of his approbation, he pronounced him among the best of the parts of his workmanship, <hi>very Good,</hi> Gen. 1. Last verse. That is, <hi>entirely and perfectly so.</hi> Accordingly the wise man tells us, <hi>that God made man upright,</hi> Eccl. 7. 29.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if he had not bin so, he would have bin a strange <hi>Image of God,</hi> as unlike, and therefore as unlikely to represent him, as beauty would be to be represented by deformity, or order by confusion. For should we suppose man at first made in such a condition, as he hath since by his own folly brought himself to: with ignorance in his understanding, stubbornness and perverseness in his will, rebellion and disorder in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: could any man in his right wits, think such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son made after the <hi>likeness and similitude of God.</hi> Can Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, contention, and disorder, be a transcript of that pure and immaculate nature of God; in whom there is nothing but Light, Beauty, and Harmony. I confess a Socinian, who hath formed an Idea of his God, after the likeness and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a man; who hath furnished us with the notion of a material and a finite God; of a frail and impotent Deity, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, made up of the weakness, and liable to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men; in short, he that can introduce his God as the Heathens did their Deities, looking pale with grief, as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it, trembling for fear, perplexed with doubtfull and uncertain expectations of future events: may for ought I know account blindness, and that disorder which arises from the contention and struggle between the faculties, no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one of his noblest Creatures. In the mean time I hope others may be allowed to think and speak more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of their <hi>Creator,</hi> and of one of the most admirable parts of his workmanship, Man: I mean in his first and original

It was a perfection that belonged to him in his state of <hi>Innocence and Integrity,</hi> which the Socinians themselves will sometimes allow man to be created in. For this <hi>Integrity</hi> in man consider'd as a rational Creature, and endued with freedom, and a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his own actions, necessarily supposes both knowledge and holyness: these being <hi>moral perfections,</hi> of which man is capable, and which belong to him in his Original frame and constitution; and without which he could not have discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his duty, nor have bin, <hi>in eum usum in quem comparatus erat, aptus &amp; idoneus,</hi> (as <hi>Socinus</hi> expresses it) fit for the end and purpose for which he was created, which was to serve and praise his maker, and consequently the want of them in any just degree, must have bin a degree of imperfection: which would not only be a disparagement to man, but must have reflected a dishonour upon God, in forming a Creature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of those perfections of which he was capable, and which were every way suited to his constitution. To make this plain, let us for once make an absurd supposition, that God at first created man, with imperfect Organs of sence, speech and motion; Purblind and slow of hearing, with a faultering tongue and feeble knees; stammering when he spoke, and staggering as he went; who should complain of pains, aches and infirmities, as soon as he came into the world, as others use to do when they are ready to go out of it.

                  <p>You will say that a little degree of knowledge might have served <hi>Adam</hi>'s turn in Paradise; and that no other Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was requisite, but a freedom from Sin, that is, from any stain or defilement of his nature, <hi>ut omni labe ac vitio careat,</hi> as <hi>Socinus</hi> speaks, To this I <hi>Ans.</hi> besides all that hath been said before, man's <hi>liberum arbitrium,</hi> his free will, and that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>power and dominion</hi> over his own actions, which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries allow <hi>Adam</hi> to be possessed of, in his state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, is a sufficient confutation of this assertion. For first, Free will supposes knowledge, the knowledge of God, himself, his duty; of all actions which he was obliged to perform, and of all the circumstances of them likewise, without which they would not be voluntary <note n="1" place="bottom">Tò <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>2. As his <hi>dominion</hi> over other creatures, gave him authority and supposed <hi>Abilities</hi> in him to govern them: so this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over his own actions naturally and necessarily implies a <hi>power</hi> in him to govern himself, and all his affairs. And this again necessarily supposes a subordination between the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of his Soul, in which subordination we make Original Righteousness to consist. For he that cannot govern his <hi>thoughts and desires,</hi> will never have the entire government of his <hi>actions,</hi> of which the former are the springs and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. You will say there may be some struggle between
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62459:53"/> sense and reason, and yet reason may preserve its authority, and tho with difficulty, yet may keep the affections in order. <hi>I Answ.</hi> Any such struggle or resistance is inconsistent with that <hi>Absolute power</hi> over our actions, which we call free will: and which we suppose <hi>Adam</hi> to be invested with in the state of Innocence. Every propension to evil, every reluctance of our passions against our reason, is a real weakening of our dominion, which is not <hi>complete,</hi> when it is not able to keep all quiet in the Soul. No man was ever yet master of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that could not master his own inclinations, and therefore wherever that authority is entire, it will enable men to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>desires,</hi> and to govern the <hi>affections,</hi> so as that they may be at the beck of Reason, to move or stand still, like the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi>'s servant in the Gospel, and to act according to the direction of the superior faculties: otherwise a man in great measure hath lost his authority, and from being a master, in a little time will become a slave.</p>
                  <p>In short, any inclination or proneness to Sin, is inconsistent with an <hi>absolute freedom</hi> over our actions: as is evident from this state of our corrupt nature, in which our liberty is so much weakened and impaired, that the bare commands of reason, neither are, nor ever were able since the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> to keep the passions in order, without the assistance of some higher and supernatural principle, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace of God: as is evident from the experience of all the world, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Christians, except <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> if these latter may deserve that name.</p>
                  <p>And this was the state of man in Paradise; not a state of <hi>impeccability,</hi> as if it were impossible for him to Sin: for he was capable of being tempted, and as the event shewed, of being foyled by the temptation. But all this was through his own default, who might if he had pleased, have rejected the temptation, before it did in the least prevail over him.</p>
                  <p>All which, notwithstanding the opposition that at some time is made to it, at other times seemes to be acknowledged by our adversaries themselves. <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell us, first that man

First, whereas they generally say that freedom is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to the will in all its actions, being its essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial property which cannot be separated from it: Here <hi>Limb.</hi> tells us that the will of <hi>Adam</hi> in his state of integrity, was not a <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Voluntas Adami non fuit neutra, in bonum ac malum aeque indifferens: sed antequam ei Lex à Deo posita erat, rectitudinem habuit naturalem, ut inordinate nec concupisceret, nec posset.

                  <p>For first I would fain know of him, how that will can be

                     <hi>free,</hi> according to the notion of freedom as it is stated by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and all the Remonstrants, which is not <hi>neutra, a neutral or Indifferent will.</hi> Here he saith, <hi>Adami voluntas non fuit neutra &amp; Indifferens:</hi> and yet in the same chapter he describes liberty by this very <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <hi>indifference</hi> which he makes to be the formal notion of it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> I desire to be informed, how it is possible for <hi>Adam</hi> to preserve his freedom, and yet not be able to act against the law of nature and the direction of his conscience: since the very notion of liberty according to him, supposes an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute power in the will over its own actions, to perform, or suspend the performance of them at its own pleasure. <hi>Sect.</hi> the fifth he told us, <hi>Adamus contra legem naturae, &amp; conscientiam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care non poterat.</hi> And yet <hi>Section</hi> the <hi>20th.

                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> I want a further Resolution, how <hi>Adams</hi> will could be <hi>free;</hi> and yet he in the mean time act by a <hi>natural instinct,</hi> which is nothing else but in other words a <hi>necessity of nature.</hi> For whether that <hi>instinct</hi> proceeds from sense or reason, in this case it makes no difference, the actions which flow from it, being in both cases equally necessary and unavoidable. And therefore <hi>Limborch</hi> tells us, that <hi>Adam</hi> was governed by the law of nature, as <hi>infants</hi> are by the direction of sense, and sensitive appetites, who cannot be presumed before they arrive at the use of reason, to act by deliberation and choice. Now from hence one of these two things must unavoidably follow; Either first that <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocence had

Or <hi>2dly,</hi> that liberty and necessity may be reconciled, which at other times they tell us can no more be done, then you can tye both parts of a contradiction together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The other known principle of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants,</hi> which is clearly destroyed by <hi>Limborch</hi> is, <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Ubicunque necessitas dominatur, ibi Religioni non est locus,</hi> Exam. Censurae in Conf. Remonst. p. 82.</note> that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and necessity,</hi> are absolutely inconsistent; Forasmuch as there can be no roome left for the one, where the other doth prevail. Now that which necessarily results from hence must be this; First that <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, acting by a natural instinct, was <hi>incapable of Religion;</hi> or <hi>2dly,</hi> that <hi>Moral Righteousness,</hi> which consists in the practice of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which right reason, and the law of nature prescribes, is no part of it. Either of which must be a very impious as well as a very absurd assertion: for it must either suppose man, at his first Creation not to be endued with reason: or if he were, that he was not obliged to act according to the rules and directions of it: which to affirm, were plainly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and alter the nature of things, and to overthrow the first and original notions of Good and Evil.</p>
                  <p>Now by what we have thus laid down out of the writings of the Adversaries of this Truth, one would think that there should be no great difference between us, but that we were if not perfectly agreed, at least in a fair way to be so. And indeed if we had to deal with men whose meaning might be guessed at by their words: or who would stand to any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and be consistent with themselves; this part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy might easily be ended, or at least, might be fairly accommodated: but when they come to explain themselves, they and we, notwithstanding this seeming consent, are found to be at as great a distance, as the <hi>Arctick and Antarctick Poles.</hi>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62459:56"/>
                  <p>For tho <hi>Socinus</hi> acknowledges that God at first made man after his own <hi>Image:</hi> yet he tells us that that <hi>Image,</hi> as we shewed before, consisted only in the <hi>Dominion</hi> which God gave him over the whole Creation: and that all other notions of similitude, whereby he may be thought to resemble God, are but <hi>Commenta Humana,</hi> the inventions of men; not any part of the Revelation contained in the Holy Scriptures. In short, that <hi>Adam</hi> was born a frail, mortal Creature, having only the bare faculties of understanding and will, but without the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments of either, being neither endued with wisdom nor holyness: a pure <hi>rasa Tabula,</hi> capable indeed of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, but having no characters either of wisdom or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, engraven upon his mind, by the finger of God, when he first dropped out of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider particulars, and thereby we shall be enabled to take a clearer view, and frame a better judgment of these <hi>Socinian</hi> opinions: and how far they are from being conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scripture account, and the notions which both Jews and Christians, have from thence formed of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                     </gap>, the supreme and leading faculty of the Soul, the understanding; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we told you before that God Created man as in perfect <hi>stature of Body,</hi> so likewise in full <hi>ripeness of understanding,</hi> so that he had a perfect knowledge of God, himself, his duty, and all parts of the Creation: <hi>Socinus</hi> will tell you that all this is a great mistake. For tho he acknowledges that God Created him in perfect strength and vigor, at the full age, and with the complete dimensions of a <hi>Man;</hi> yet he would have us believe, that in his understanding he was a <hi>meer child;</hi> which was to grow up with him, by observation, study and experience as in other men. But otherwise at his first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, that he had very little knowledge of himself, or any thing about him. So that if you were to form an Idea of man from the writings of <hi>Socinus,</hi> you might fancy him to be an overgrown Baby, at his first coming into the world, gaping, and staring, and casting his eies about him; surprised

                  <p>And with him agree the Remonstrants, who tell us that <hi>Concupiscence,</hi> or the first motions and inclinations to Sin are natural, and were found in our first Parents, in their first and

                  <p>If this be so, then I must confess that what we have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted of the subjection of the passions to reason, and the subordination between the powers and faculties of the Soul, in the state of innocence, may be well accounted, what <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>

                  <p>For <hi>1st,</hi> The account they give us of this matter, is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the <hi>wisdom</hi> of God. For to suppose man at his first Creation, made with his affections <hi>struggling</hi> against his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and sometimes getting the <hi>upper hand</hi> of it; is to have the same imperfect view of <hi>Adam,</hi> as that poor blind man in the Gospel had of other persons, who when his eyes were first opened, <hi>saw men as trees walking,</hi> Mark 8. 24. A man as Naturalists tell us is a Tree inverted. Now since Reason is the supreme faculty of the Soul, and the affections may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly styled the Feet of it, upon which it moves; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription which the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Remonstrants</hi> give us of <hi>Adam,</hi> is just as if you should represent a man walking upon his head, with his heels capering in the Air: which is a very proper posture for a man newly stollen out of Bedlam, or for one fit to be sent thither: but a very unbecoming one for him, who just came out of the hands of his maker, with the approbation of <hi>goodness and uprightness.</hi> Can we think it agreeable to the wisdom of God, to proceede with so <hi>great care and deliberation</hi> to the making a piece of workmanship so irregular and deformed: we may as well think God made man with a <hi>distorted Countenance,</hi> as with a <hi>depraved mind.</hi> It is true indeed, by the Devils cunning, and mans folly, things at present are brought to this pass: the order of nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite inverted. But it will become us to think more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently of the Allwise former of things, than to imagin, that he who made every thing else with that admirable symmetry and proportion of parts; all things <hi>in number weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> so as that they might best answer the ends of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; should now <hi>in extremo actu deficere,</hi> in the conclusion of all, produce such a rude inartificial piece, who would have been so far from being the <hi>Crown and Ornament,</hi> that he would really have bin the <hi>disparagement and disgrace</hi> of the Creation.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62459:60"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> As this is unbecoming the wisdom, so it is opposite to the Holyness of God, because hereby God is made the Author of Sin: for if the contention between the superior and inferior faculties of the Soul, and a proneness and inclination to Sin be natural, and at the same time be a moral evil: for as much as God is undoubtedly the <hi>Author of nature,</hi> he must by this Hypothesis, at the same time be the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi> Now that <hi>Concupiscence</hi> or a propensity to evil is Sin, I think may easily be made to appear from this consideration, that it is a violation of that <hi>great fundamental</hi> Law of placing the whole soul and affection entirely upon God. <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind, this is the first and great Commandement;</hi> Mat. 22. 37, 38.</p>
                  <p>I hope I need not be put to the trouble of proving, either <hi>1st,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> in his state of innocence was under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this Law. Or <hi>2dly,</hi> That he had compleat abilities and full power to obey it. Or <hi>3dly.</hi> That this Law, tho it takes in the outward actions, yet that it chiefly and principally respects the Soul; the motions and inclinations of which come under its first and immediate obligation. All this I shall take for granted: and from hence I argue, that <hi>Adam</hi> being by virtue of this Law obliged to place the whole bent and inclination of his mind upon God (which is the meaning of <hi>Loving him with all thy Soul, and with all thy might</hi>) every propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evil must be a direct breach and violation of it, and consequently a Sin. There is nothing that I can think of, which can possibly be replyed to this by our Adversaries, but one of these two things. Either <hi>1st,</hi> that there may be this concupiscence and <hi>inclination</hi> to sin without the <hi>affection</hi> to it: Or <hi>2dly,</hi> that an <hi>affection</hi> to sin may be consistent with the perfect and <hi>entire Love</hi> of God, neither of which can be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed without great absurdity.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>1st,</hi> All desire is naturally founded in Love, which is, usually and properly distinguished into <hi>amor complacentiae,</hi> and <hi>amor desiderii.</hi> Now desire is nothing else but the tendency of the Soul towards its beloved object. As it is therefore in a pair
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62459:61"/> of Scales, the inclination or leaning of them towards either side, must proceed from the greater degrees of weight, that are in one more then in the other: so it is in all desires, which are the <hi>moral inclinations</hi> of the soul. When a man desires any thing, it must proceed from his affection to, or complacencie in that thing. And if sin be the object of those desires, it can be for no other reason, but because it is the object of his affection; for no man ever yet could <hi>desire</hi> that which he had an <hi>aversation</hi> to.</p>
                  <p>2. Where there is a perfect love of God, there the whole soul is <hi>entirely bent</hi> upon him: and this is absolutely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with any inclination to sin: As much as it is for a man to stand bolt upright, and stoope towards the ground: to be in perfect health, and yet have a tendency to a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor or a Consumption. Do you think it was possible for <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, to have gone with her face directly towards <hi>Zoar,</hi> and yet at the same time to have cast a glance towards <hi>Sodom?</hi> I confess it is no new thing for a man to have his face look one way, and his affections go quite another. But that a man should place his affections <hi>entirely upon God,</hi> and yet <hi>lean</hi> towards sin, is absolutely impossible: as much as it is for him at the same time to go backward and forward, to wink with his eies, and yet stare another man directly in the face. In short, I would ask this plain question, whether to love God with all the Soul, were a duty incumbent upon <hi>Adam,</hi> or not? If they say no, I would fain know, who hath told the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that God gave <hi>Adam</hi> leave to place any part of his affection upon that, to which he himself hath declared an <hi>eternal and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hatred:</hi> that the same thing may lawfully be the object of mans <hi>desires,</hi> and Gods <hi>aversation:</hi> if they say it was his duty, then I desire to be informed, how it is possible for a man to love God with the <hi>whole Soul,</hi> and yet reserve any <hi>part</hi> of it for his sins: which is as plain and as dangerous a contradiction as it was for <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>bring the whole price of his estate to the Apostles</hi> and yet to <hi>keep back part</hi> for his own use, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>But against all this that hath been said, of the <hi>perfection
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62459:61"/> and integrity</hi> of mans nature, there is one objection that is commonly made with great plausibility; and that is, if <hi>Adam</hi> had bin sent into the world, with all those moral accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which we have assign'd him, one would think it were impossible for him to have sinned. And that he must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have bin innocent, but impeccable. For first, if there were that <hi>submission</hi> of his affections to his reason, as is pretended: how comes it to pass that they ever <hi>rebelled</hi> against it? Why did not his reason subdue the first and earlyest motions of his sensitive appetite, and strangle them in the birth. If reason had so great an authority, as we talk of, the least beck or nod would have calmed any present uproar of the passions, and have kept all quiet in the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Or if we suppose the temptation to begin at the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, sin entering that way into the Soul: it may be ask'd, how it was possible, that a person endued with so much <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and sagacity,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> is supposed to be master of, could ever be wrought upon to do a thing so contrary to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>viz.</hi> to hearken to the <hi>suggestion</hi> of an evil spirit, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the plain declaration, and <hi>peremtory threatening</hi> of his Maker. He must be strangely surprized one would think, and tho he had great knowledge, sure he had not his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or at least his consideration at that time about him. To which I <hi>Ans.</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> tho created with all the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned excellencies, yet was made in a state <hi>of probation and tryal:</hi> and tho perfectly good, yet not so confirmed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but that he was left in the <hi>hands of his own counsel,</hi> so that his happyness or misery was purely in his own power. His state of <hi>innocence,</hi> was a state of <hi>liberty:</hi> being endued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with <hi>Righteousness,</hi> but at the same time with <hi>Freedom</hi> likewise, having a compleat power over his own actions, so that he might either do an action, or suspend the doing of it; hearken to his reason, or disobey the dictates of it, as he thought fit. He was made up of such faculties, whereby he was capable of being <hi>tempted,</hi> and upon the account of the before mentioned liberty, of <hi>complying with the temptation:</hi> in which there was something offered by the Devil to gratifie
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62459:62"/> his <hi>sense,</hi> and something to work upon his <hi>understanding. The Tree was good for Food, and pleasant to the Eye,</hi> Gen. 3. 6. Here was a plain temptation offered to the senses. You will say reason might easily have restrained the sensitive Appetite, and then the temptation would have bin insignificant. But we know that reason it self may be perverted, and here was something offered to bribe that. <hi>In the day you eat thereof your eies shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil,</hi> ver. 5. so that now it was a Tree, which was not only pleasant to the eies, but <hi>a Tree to be desired to make one wise,</hi> ver. 6. Place therefore the <hi>temptation</hi> and let it begin where you will: by virtue of that Dominion which <hi>Adam</hi> had over his own actions, he might, if he so thought fit, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the dictates of sense, against the directions of reason, and <hi>suffer</hi> the <hi>suggestions</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> to prevail against the <hi>commands</hi> of God. But however tho the senses might be wrought upon, and the affections consequently excited; yet the <hi>will</hi> one would think should not be moved but by the direction of reason, and it is scarce to be imagined how so <hi>pure,</hi> so <hi>refined a reason</hi> could be imposed upon. Ans. yes, the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self is capable of being wrought upon, either <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> by Argument, or <hi>mediately</hi> by perswasion, and the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the senses; which are apt to make wise men <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate,</hi> and <hi>inconsideration</hi> is one great step to error; and not only so, but the senses oftentimes transfer their own preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices upon the understanding; nothing being more usual, than for men to believe that to be true, which they earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire should prove so. But when all is done, tho we should grant that the affections were moved, and the understanding so far perverted as to act so <hi>foolishly,</hi> it is not easily understood, how the will, which was so holy and righteous, should ever consent to so <hi>wicked an action;</hi> and without that consent, the action would never have bin committed. <hi>I Ans.</hi> This might be done, by virtue of that <hi>power</hi> which the will had over its own Actions: for tho it were a <hi>righteous,</hi> it was a <hi>free will:</hi> and consequently capable of acting according to its duty, or contrary to it. But to put this matter beyond all doubt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62459:62"/> or at least beyond the cavils of our adversaries; I shall offer two instances, which are allowed by them, for proof and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration of this matter: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Adam,</hi> tho in a state of the greatest perfection, yet might be capable of consenting to a temptation, and consequently, (as it happened) of being overcome by it.</p>
                  <p>And the first instance shall be that of a <hi>Regenerate man</hi> whose condition is thus represented by <hi>Limb.</hi>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62459:63"/>
                  <p>If you enquire how such an one can be prevailed upon, to act so contrary to his knowledge, nay to his inclinations, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>inward concupiscence</hi> to assist and help forward the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: He will tell us, it is by virtue of that <hi>essential</hi> power of the will, which is not destroyed by grace: the most Holy man being left in a state of freedom, and therefore may be enticed by the <hi>deceitfulness of Sin.</hi> The same answer may serve for <hi>Adam,</hi> whose case seemes to be in a manner paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel: only it may be said that the Remonst. and Socin. do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>motus primo primi concupiscentiae,</hi> or the first and original inclinations to Sin to be in <hi>Adam:</hi> which, as they were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the exercise of virtue, so likewise were they the subject for the temptation to work upon, and his sin consequently might enter in at that door, which by our account is shut, so that we leave no passage for its admittance.</p>
                  <p>Tho this objection if we had time to consider it, would make no great difference, yet I shall produce another instance, which is beyond all exception, and that is the case of the fallen Angels: who at the first instant of their Creation, were possessed of all the advantages both of knowledge and righteousness, in a much greater and more sublime degree than man in the state of innocence was capable of, whose spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature gave them many advantages above man: who tho he had no <hi>vicious inclinations</hi> originally put into his nature; yet he was made up of <hi>sense</hi> as well as <hi>reason,</hi> and had other <hi>appetites</hi> to be gratified besides that <hi>of knowledge,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had more wayes than one for the temptation to enter, and might therefore the more easily be seduced. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be said, that Angels are not so <hi>immaterial</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may fondly imagin, being made up of other ingredients, besides reason and knowledge, and consequently may have other appetites to gratifie. <hi>Ex alia materia constant, quam ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> saith Socin, <hi>De statu primi Hom. contra Pucc. p.</hi> 307.</p>
                  <p>But be that as it will, they are as <hi>immaterial</hi> as the Soul of man at least, neither are they clogged with such <hi>dull, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy substances</hi> as our bodies are, which are joyned to the Soul, and with it make up the essence of man. In short they were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62459:63"/> not composed of <hi>senses,</hi> nor consequently had any <hi>sensual appetites</hi> to gratifie in opposition to their reason: neither had they any <hi>external enemy</hi> to entice, solicite and push them forward, which was the case of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was seduced by his wife, as his wife was by the Serpent, and beguiled by his subtilety. And yet these <hi>holy, knowing, refined, subtile spirits</hi> were wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and either thro pride, envy, curiosity, or whatever else it was, did rebell against their maker.</p>
                  <p>But how could envy find a passage into the minds of these pure and immaculate spirits, any more than <hi>wisdom enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Soul defiled with Sin?</hi> What could they possibly desire, which they were not allready possessed of? What accession could be made to their happyness, what addition to their subtil and refined knowledge? Did they hope to mend their condition by revolting from their maker? How could so wild an imagination enter into the minds of such wise and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent beings? Had they no knowledge of God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the <hi>infinite distance</hi> between both? If they had not, let us no longer <hi>magnifie their wisdom</hi> nor <hi>aggravate their crime,</hi> which their ignorance must extenuate, if not totally excuse. If they had, how could they think of fighting against God, and not know that in the conclusion they should be mastered by him? They could not but be sensible, that they had to do with him who was neither an impotent nor a careless be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; consequently, one who would be <hi>provoked by an affront,</hi> and could revenge it. <hi>Ero sunilis altissimo,</hi> might be a wish, fit for a <hi>proud,</hi> but not for a <hi>wise and intelligent</hi> spirit; who could not but know the attempt to be impossible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ridiculous; and consequently inconsistent with an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of wisdom, and much more with the deep and piercing judgments of those once glorious Angels.</p>
                  <p>This and a great deal more might be urged to shew the improbability of their <hi>Apostacy and Fall.</hi> But it is in vain to argue against plain matter of Fact. They did enter into a conspiracy against their Maker, are turned Rebels and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, at the instigation, as it is like, of one <hi>Chiestain and Ringleader,</hi> who is stiled <hi>Sathan,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> by way of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62459:64"/> and have left their first habitation, being tumbled down into those lower regions, where they are <hi>reserved in chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great Day,</hi> Jud. 6. All which the Scriptures have assured us the truth of: and how unlikely or improbable soever it may seem, yet is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by those persons with whom we are now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given an account of man in his state of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> now we come to consider him in his <hi>Fallen state,</hi> and what the Scriptures have informed us of it, is this. That <hi>Adam</hi> having disobeyed his maker, in eating of the <hi>Forbidden Fruite,</hi> became obnoxious to the sentence and penalty of the Law, which was <hi>Death. In the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely dye,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. But besides the punishment of <hi>Death,</hi> he was further lyable to a <hi>twofold misery,</hi> which was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable consequence of his disobedience. First, hereby he lost his integrity, and a great measure of that Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which we before described. <hi>2dly,</hi> He forfeited the favor of God, which made up the principal and noblest part of that happyness which he was possessed of in the state of innocence. And of this, the curse which he brought upon the earth; the toyl, and labor, and sorrows which he pulled upon his own head; and much more his expulsion out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and separation from the Tree of Life, were an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument; as being the plain indications of Gods high displeasure against him. All sin doth more or less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file mans nature, and therefore must put him out of Gods favor, who cannot behold the least impurity without Aversation: no unclean thing can enter into his presence, but must for ever be excluded and banished, from the <hi>habitation of his Holyness, and the place where his honour dwelleth.</hi>

To which I Answer, this might very well happen from the nature of the thing, as well as by the appointment and judgment of Almighty God. And this I shall make out by two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which cannot well be denyed by our Adversaries.</p>
                  <p>The first shall be that of a <hi>Regenerate man,</hi> who by their unanimous confession may fall from a state of Grace, and that not only by repeated and multiplyed acts, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of <hi>one great sin,</hi> such as is <hi>Idolatry, Murther, Adultery, Perjury, denyal of the Faith,</hi> and the like, which do not only put a man out of Gods favor; but destroy the state of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; which they say is inconsistent, with the single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of any such enormous sins. And this they prove from the examples of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> who by the commission of those two great sins of <hi>Adultery, and Idolatry,</hi> did totally fall from Grace, as well as from the just hopes and title to Salvation. It is true indeed, they say, the <hi>habit of Faith</hi> in <hi>David</hi> was not by this sin totally extinguished; neither do we say the like of the Righteousness of <hi>Adam</hi> after his Fall; but however, <hi>Facto isto habitum sanctitatis infregit, actum fidei consequentem, obedientiam seu sanctitatem peremit, assensu licet ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quali
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62459:65"/> adhuc permanente,</hi> as <note n="1" place="bottom">Lib. 5. Cap. 82.</note>
                     <hi>Limb.</hi> speaks, he did thereby weaken the <hi>habit of Righteousness,</hi> and destroyed his Faith as it was a <hi>principle of Holyness,</hi> or a <hi>saving Grace:</hi> which is all that we need to affirm of the effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, which was by the confession of <hi>Episcop. peccatum enorme.</hi> For tho as to the external Fact, of eating the forbidden Fruit, it was but <hi>One,</hi> yet if we consider the ingredients, causes, and preparations to it, it was a <hi>Complication of Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I suppose our adversaries will acknowledge, that <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sinned was tempted; that he hearkened to the voice of the Tempter; that he broke thro the strongest restraints, <hi>viz.</hi> the threatning of <hi>Death</hi> annexed to the prohibition, which must necessarily suppose in him <hi>insidelilty,</hi> a contempt of Gods Authority, and a kind of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>revolt</hi> from his Maker: man being now no longer to be <hi>subject</hi> to God, but to be <hi>equal</hi> with him. So that his Sin had some Affinity, with the Pride and Rebellion of the Apostate Angels, (which was the second instance to be given for the illustration of this matter) which sin of theirs, hath so totally infected and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned their natures, that they are in a manner made up of Pride, Malice, Envy, and Wickedness. In short, it hath so entirely corrupted them, that there are no <hi>reliques,</hi> no <hi>foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps</hi> remaining of their <hi>first and original purity:</hi> not the least spark of goodness left, but all inclinations to, and endeavours after it are absolutely and eternally extinguished.</p>
                  <p>But we need not so far aggravate <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery consequent upon it. Let it suffice to say, that it might be of as great efficacy, as either the Adultery of <hi>David,</hi> or Idolatry of <hi>Solomon</hi> was, to <hi>weaken</hi> if not to destroy his <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteousness:</hi> to put him out of the favor of God, and consequently, to deprive him of his happiness and integrity together.</p>
                  <p>This was the effect of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin upon himself, but it did not rest here, but <hi>reached all his posterity:</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> must be considered as the <hi>root</hi> of mankind: and so in a <hi>natural way,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62459:65"/> his happyness or misery might be conveyed to his posterity; and much more when we consider him as a <hi>Foederal Head:</hi> God having made a covenant with him, as the representative of all mankind, so that according to his obedience or diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience respectively, his posterity was either to enjoy or be deprived of that happyness, and those advantages he was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of; the promises and threatnings comprehending them all. And this the Apostle plainly makes out, in the comparison instituted by him between <hi>Adam and Christ;</hi> who were both, tho in different respects, the Heads and Representatives of all mankind. And so they are put in opposition to one another by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both in the 1 <hi>Cor. 15. ch.</hi> And especially in the <hi>5th</hi> of the <hi>Rom. v. 12. For as by one man Sin entered into the World and death by Sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</hi> That is, as the punishment was transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his posterity; <note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Hammond <hi>very well observes, That the 13th and 14th verses are to be read as in a Parenthesis, the second part of the Comparison, which respects Christ, rising higher than the former which related to</hi> Adam, <hi>and so is necessarily changed from the form of a Comparison or equality, to that of an Argument</hi> à minori ad majus, <hi>from the less to the greater.</hi>

                     </gap>; the Apostle himself so explaining it in the same verse, telling us that <hi>Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more v. 19. we are told that <hi>as by the disobedience of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62459:66"/> one, many were made</hi> or constituted <hi>Sinners; so by the Obedience of one, shall many be made</hi> or constituted <hi>Righteous.</hi> Now these <hi>many,</hi> in the verse immediately foregoing 18. are said to be <hi>all men; for by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men unto Condemnation; so by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon all men to Justification of Life.</hi> By all which it is evident, that as the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of Christ was not <hi>personal;</hi> the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings indeed were in the person of Christ, but were not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated there (I mean as to their virtue and efficacy) but reached and extended to all mankind, so far, as to put all men into a capacity of Salvation, who before were under the displeasure of God, and obnoxious to the sentence of the Law: So the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was not meerly <hi>personal,</hi> but such as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved all his posterity in the same guilt, and made them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>death,</hi> which was the punishment threatned by the Law.</p>
                  <p>And this is so plainly delivered, and so often repeated by the Apostle in this chapter, that one would think there should be no room left, not only for any probable, but any the remotest doubt. Read but the <hi>12th</hi> verse and there you will find, that <hi>by one man sin entered into the World, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</hi> Where we have first, an account both of the cause and original of sin, and of its overtaking all mankind: and that is the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of <hi>Adam,</hi> he was that <hi>one man:</hi> as also of the effect and consequence of that sin, which was <hi>Death. 2dly,</hi> We have the proof of that Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that sin entered into the <hi>World,</hi> or <hi>upon all men</hi> (for those two words, as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, are equivalent, and signify one and the same thing) by a demonstration <hi>à posteriori,</hi> because <hi>Death</hi> which is the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of sin, hath overtaken all men. It is plain then, as words can make it, that Death is the punishment of sin: <hi>Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin. 2dly,</hi> it is equally evident, that since the <hi>punishment</hi> hath overtaken all men, that all are involved in the <hi>guilt:</hi> because death could not otherwise seize on all men, but because all have <hi>sinned:</hi> the crime and the punishment being of equal extent. For death, or,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62459:66"/> mortality being come into the World, seized not only on <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom it was peremtorily and expresly threatned (<hi>in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</hi>) but upon all meer men also that were afterwards born, because all were sinners. <note n="1" place="bottom">Idem ibid.</note> And that we may not think death now to be the only <hi>condition of our nature,</hi> we being mortal men, born of a mortal parent, but properly a <hi>punishment:</hi> the Apostle makes it plain beyond all contradiction v. 16. <hi>It was one man that sinned, but the judgment</hi> (or sentence,) <hi>by reason of one offence</hi> (of that one man) <hi>was unto condemnation</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>From hence it is evident, that they on whom the <hi>sentence passed,</hi> and were <hi>condemned</hi> by it, were <hi>punished</hi> for that one offence, and consequently were guilty of it: for where there is no crime, there is no punishment. And that we may not think, that the condemnation overtook <hi>Adam</hi> only: we are told the sentence was passed, and executed on all his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>So by the offence of this one,</hi> that judgment mentioned in the 16. v. <hi>came upon all men unto Condemnation,</hi> v. 18. without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For those universal forms of speech, as Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> well observes, are to be taken in the greatest and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive latitude, without exclusion of any: and there was great reason that the punishment should reach those who were involved in the guilt: <hi>for</hi> in the 19. v. <hi>by the disobedience of this one man, many,</hi> or all <hi>were made sinners,</hi> and then it is no wonder they were all liable to the same condemnation.</p>
                  <p>And thus all the Children of <hi>Adam, viz.</hi> all <hi>meer men,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his sin are become sinners, that is, Guilty of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience which is <hi>imputed</hi> to them; whereby they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of original Righteousness, born with propensions to evil, and a disability by their own natural strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any saving good; being likewise obnoxious both to a temporal death, and also to an eternal separation from the presence of God, in whose favor is life: of which <hi>Adam</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion out of Paradise, and his separation from the Tree of Life, was a Type and Figure.</p>
                  <p>And this is the plain Doctrine of the Scriptures, taught by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62459:67"/> the Catholick Church, and more particularly exlained by the Fathers and Councils, after the publishing of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy. It being not the Invention of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> as the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> formerly, and their successors of later years, have vainly (not to say maliciously) suggested. For herein he had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Ancient Church, as he himself hath proved at large in his first book against <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now consider what the opinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers is in this matter, and see whether it be agreeable to the Scripture account, both as to the sin, and the punishment.</p>

                     <hi>2dly,</hi> As to original sin, as it bespeaks the depravation of our natures, which is it self both a <hi>Sin</hi> and part of the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sin,</hi> they would perswade the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it is, <hi>Commentum humanum,</hi> a meer fable; <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin being so far from corrupting his posterity, that it had not the efficacy to corrupt the powers of his own Soul <note n="2" place="bottom">Socin. praelect.

                     <seg rend="sup">1</seg> will go one step higher, and lets us know, that this Idle story concerning Original Sin, is a <hi>Jewish fable,</hi> picked up from them by <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and introduced into the Christian Church, in order to establish those two pernicious errors concerning the <hi>Incarnation of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Baptism of Infants.</hi> From hence we may observe, what is very well worth our notice, what the opinion of the Church, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received among all good Christians (before <hi>Socinus</hi> his time) was, concerning the true reason of Christs coming into the World, (which some have since placed upon another bottom, tho with what service to Christianity may be hereafter examined) <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>reconcile mankind,</hi> and restore them to the favor of God, who were universally involved in the guilt and obnoxious to the punishment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s disobedience: and consequently <hi>2dly,</hi> How near and close a connexion there is between these two Doctrines, and therefore what great reason <hi>Socinus</hi> had to oppose the former concerning Original Sin with all his might: as being of so pernicious consequence, as to draw along with it, the acknowledgement and proof of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the dangerous Doctrine of the <hi>Redemption of the world</hi> by that means. I wonder when <hi>Socinus</hi> his hand was in, that he went no higher than <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and that he did not ascribe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of this Doctrine, as <hi>Volkel.</hi> doth that concerning the Trinity, not only to the Son of perdition, but also <hi>vetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori Satanae,</hi> to that old Serpent the Devil, the Father of all Lies and Errors.

Th. Cap. 1.</note> that <hi>Adam</hi> was at first made, as we are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62459:68"/> now born, a mortal creature, and that Death was that which was the consequence of his constitution, and the condition of his nature. That if he had <hi>not sinned,</hi> he might have dyed <hi>before,</hi> as well as <hi>after his fall:</hi> nay, you might have pronounced it as safely and peremtorily of him, as you can of any of his posterity, nay of the very Beasts, the Ox and the Asse, that he was <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>liable to Death.</hi> It is true indeed God might have exempted him from the lot and condition of his nature as he did <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> But of this he had no promise, and therefore could have no reasonable expectation. In short, <hi>Adam</hi> if he had preserved his innocence, yet <hi>might,</hi> and in all likelyhood would have dyed; his death, now by being made necessary, is, say they, become more certain than before the fall; but however if he had not sinned, according to the <hi>course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he must have dyed, and nothing but a <hi>miracle</hi> could have preserved him. Now I say that this whole account of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s, concerning the consequence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, is not only repugnant to the plain declarations of Scripture; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inconsistent with their own assertions, they being herein not more opposite to the truth, than they are to themselves. Which when it is made out, I hope we may be allowed to account this Hypothesis of theirs both <hi>impious and absurd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>1st,</hi> if we consider the sin, it is evident that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>Adam</hi>'s posterity, because, as the Scriptures formerly assured us, the <hi>punishment</hi> did so. <hi>Sin first entering into the World, and Death by sin,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. To avoid the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62459:68"/>
                     <hi>Socinus</hi> tho he durst not plainly <hi>deny</hi> the Scriptures' yet he dare <hi>pervert</hi> them, and thereby takes as effectual a course to elude their Authority, as if he had absolutely disowned it. And here, there being so close a connexion between the sin and the punishment, I must acquaint the Reader, that whilst I speak of the one, I must be forced to include the other; the sin necessarily inferring the punishment, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being the clear evidence and proof of the sin. Now then when it is urged that <hi>Death is the wages of sin,</hi> the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Author will tell us, that bare Death is not thereby intended, but necessary and eternal Death; <note n="1" place="bottom">Socin. ad Pucc. Defens. Resp. Cap. 8. <hi>Praecipua mortis causa fuerat ante peccatum, sed per peccatum tantummodo invecta est moriendi necessitas.

Cap. 1.</note> that the curse threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> relating to death, brought no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience along with it, but that what before was <hi>natural,</hi> now by his sin became <hi>necessary,</hi> which <hi>properly made it a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</hi> Now this is not to interpret Scripture, but to abuse it, and at the same time to dally with the threatnings of God, which ought to be treated with more respect. For this account, besides that it contradicts the formal notion of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, by overthrowing the true ends and reason of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting it, which plainly evinee that it cannot be <hi>natural;</hi> makes the curse of God <hi>inanis lusus,</hi> a meere trifle. Instead of trembling at, men would deride the judgments of God, and laugh at the messengers who brought the tidings of them.</p>
                  <p>Suppose a man should tell us that if we sinned, we should inevitably be exposed to <hi>Hunger and Thrist,</hi> to <hi>sleep and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness;</hi> and then upon an enquiry, (which must naturally arise hence,) how this could be a proper method to deter men from sinning, since by the condition of their nature they were ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to these infirmities, from which the greatest virtue could not protect them; he should gravely be told, that the above named threatning, tho it doth not denounce any <hi>new thing</hi> to which before they were not lyable, yet that it <hi>alters the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62459:69"/> of things. Those infirmities before were <hi>natural,</hi> but now they are become <hi>necessary,</hi> and therefore the <hi>punishment of their sins.</hi> Would any man be deterred from the practice of any the greatest wickedness by this means: for what is natural is <hi>eo ipso,</hi> upon that score necessary. All natural agents act by a necessity of nature, and cannot but act, except they are hindred in their operations. <hi>Adam</hi> was, according to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus,</hi> born a mortal creature, and by the condition of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without a Miracle he must have dyed: it is true, God might have altered the course of nature, and have exempted <hi>Adam</hi> from the Laws of Mortality; and so, if he had thought fit, if we believe the same <hi>Socinus,</hi> he might have <hi>reversed his threatnings and overruled his own decrees;</hi> so that, as far as I can see, Death was equally necessary to <hi>Adam,</hi> before as well as after his Fall: a <hi>miracle of Mercy</hi> could have saved him in one case, and nothing less than a <hi>miracle of Power</hi> could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served him in the other.</p>
                  <p>To make the absurdity of this <hi>Socinian</hi> assertion the more apparent, let us suppose, that by the settled order and laws of nature; and by the powerful influences of the Stars, the old world had bin lyable to be overflown by a Deluge, and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to be burnt with Lightning: and then that <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> should have endeavoured to deter the men of those times, from their evil courses, by denouncing those Calamities against them; would they not (think you,) have laughed at those <hi>preachers of Righteousness,</hi> who would have bin unto them, what <hi>Lot</hi> really was to the <hi>Sodomites, like men that mocked?</hi> Or should any man now pretend to reform the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Age he lives in, and in order to it, should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint people if they did not amend their lives, that God at a certain time (by an Eclipse, which of it self would certainly happen) would darken the Luminaries of Heaven, so that the <hi>Moon should look black, and the Sun should not give his light:</hi> Would any man of any tolerable knowledg in the motions of the Heavenly bodys, be otherwise affected, than to deride the folly of any such pretender, to know and foretel the judgments of God? He could not but look upon such an
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62459:69"/> one to be an <hi>Impostor,</hi> and account this <hi>diviner mad.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as this were only a fit method, (by such Bugbears) to fright Fools and Children into their duty.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said that Adam was but an <hi>Infant in knowledge,</hi> who knew very little of himself, or any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him; and therefore this might be a proper method to work upon his weakness and ignorance, who tho he was made mortal, knew nothing of his mortality: tho he was by the constitution of his nature lyable to Death, yet he might dream of living for ever, as was said before. Now this is to abuse Scripture as well as <hi>Adam,</hi> and if this be not trifling with the Threatnings and Judgments of Almighty God, I know not what is.</p>
                  <p>Indeed this whole matter as it is delivered by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> is so odd, so contrary to the plain declarations of Scripture, that to preserve a seeming reverence for, and yet to avoid the conviction of it, it engages them in an account, so awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and perplexed, that it was plain, they were so far from giving any reasonable satisfaction to others, that they could not satisfie themselves.</p>

Nay I thought it was therefore seemingly unjust, because of the punishment which was consequent to the imputation; for without the former, the latter would have carryed no great inconvenience along with it.</p>
                  <p>You will say it sems hard, that men should be punished for anothers offence. <hi>Ans.</hi> It was so anothers, as at the same time to be their own. <hi>Ob.</hi> But all this must be by imputation, and thats the difficulty. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scriptures affirm it and thats enough: it being plainly repugnant to reason, as well as true piety, either to disown the Authority, or contradict the meaning of those inspired writings, in such matters which are plainly delivered there, because we cannot comprehend the reasons, or solve all the difficulties relating to them: it would much better become us to supect our own shallow
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62459:72"/> reasonings, than, in a matter of fact affirmed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to question the truth and justice of Gods dealings with men. And for illustration of this matter, I shall produce two, instances, in which the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> (who in conjunction with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> are the great adversaries of this truth) are puzzled to give an account of some of Gods dealings with men: and yet for all that, they neither can deny the matter of fact, nor dare impeach either the <hi>wisdom or righteousness</hi> of those dispensations.</p>
                  <p>The first thing that I shall instance in, shall be the <hi>presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God,</hi> his forcknowledg of future and contingent events, such as depend upon the <hi>spontaneous</hi> and <hi>arbitrary determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of mens free will: This is plainly revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet how we shall be able to reconcile it to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, which God makes use of for the reclaiming of <hi>obstinate and incorrigible sinners,</hi> who he foresees will not be reclaimed; is a work of great, and perhaps of insuperable difficulty, at least in the opinion, and according to the hypothesis of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> of whom we are at present speaking. What now is to be done in this case; if you please we will refer this matter to <hi>Episcopius,</hi> and abide by his determination. Is it fit to deny Gods foreknowledge, because we cannot solve all the doubts and objections that may be made against it? <note n="1" place="bottom">

I come now to consider, the <hi>corruption and depravation</hi> of humane nature, which as was said before, is both it self a sin, and likewise the other part of the punishment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin. For the clearing of which matter, I am to make out these three things. <hi>First,</hi> That the nature of man is universally corrupted and depraved. <hi>2dly,</hi> That this corruption and depravation of humane nature is truely and properly a moral evil, or sin. <hi>3dly,</hi> That it is the effect and consequence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s disobedience: and this when it is made out, will serve for a sufficient Answer to three <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Opinio haec triplici ratione vera esse non potest, primum quia concupiscentiam istam, sive ad peccandum proclivitatem, in omnibus prorsus hominibus naturaliter esse non constat: deinde, qui etiam si de eo constaret, non propterea illud esset, quia Adamus à quo omnes prognati sumus, divinum illud praeceptum transgressus fuerit: postremo, quia cupiditas ista &amp; ad peccandum pronitas, cum conjunctam secum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis ipsius in quo est culpam non habeat, ejus peccatum proprie dici non potest.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin.

                     </note> for proof of this pollution of mens nature which we are speaking of.</p>
                  <p>But indeed if the Scriptures were silent; the <hi>experience</hi> of all men, in all Ages of the World, would be an uncontrolable evidence of it, and might justly be thought of that weight, as to beare down all opposition to a matter of fact, so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally and irrefragably attested.

                     <hi>natural,</hi> and consequently innocent, as being out of the reach of mans power; which render him therefore neither worthy of blame, nor liable to punishment; that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence</hi> is indeed an infirmity, or weakness, a languor and defect of our nature, but no Sin. Now this opinion falls under very many, and those great inconveniencies, and tends to lead men into sundry dangerous errors, which are not more opposite to Scripture, than they are repugnant to reason and piety.</p>
                  <p>For first, right reason will tell us, that all faculties and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, whether natural or acquired, together with the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which flow from them, are <hi>distinguished, and specified</hi> by their objects. And this is very apparent in moral actions; where tho a good object <hi>alone</hi> will not be sufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an action virtuous, yet it is absolutely requisite to make it such; and an unlawful object, doth absolutely and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably render an action which is conversant about it unlawful, and consequently sinful. From hence it must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that, That proness and inclination to sin which is to be found in all men, as it comprehends <hi>the first desires,</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal tendency</hi> of the affections towards that which is evil, must it self likewise be evil. And therefore to say as <hi>Limb.</hi> doth (as we quoted him before <hi>p.</hi> 23.) that concupiscence, <hi>quatenus fertur in rem illicitam,</hi> as it is conversant about an unlawful or sinful object, is no sin, can amount to no less than a plain contradiction.</p>
                  <p>You will say the <hi>consent of the will</hi> is necessary to make those Original desires sinful. Ans. no, not to make those motions
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62459:76"/> sinful <hi>in themselves;</hi> for they must be so antecedently to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the will, otherwise that consent will never make an innocent action evil. It is true indeed, by the tenor of the new Covenant, they shall not be imputed to them who are regenerate and believe in Christ, but that doth not hinder, but that they may be, and are in themselves <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>sinful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Right Reason will tell us, that whatever is prohibited by the Law of God, is <hi>eo nomine,</hi> upon that very score un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, the Law being the measure of Right and Wrong; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being two words that signifie one and the same thing. Now the same reason informs us, or if that should be silent in this case, the Scriptures will assure us, that the Law of God prohibits those original inclinations and lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after prohibited objects. This appears, partly from that great and fundamental Law, <hi>of Loving God with all the soul, and all the might,</hi> which was mentioned before <hi>p.</hi> 25. Which <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Love of God is inconsistent with any degree of <hi>affection or inclination to sin;</hi> (as was shewed there and need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated.) And more plainly from the Apostles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right affirmation Rom. 7. 7. <hi>I had not known sin but by the Law: for I had not known lust, except the Law had said thou shalt not covet.</hi> From which words these two things are evident. <hi>1st.</hi> That the sin which the Apostle knew was Lust. <hi>2dly,</hi> That the Law which forbad it, was the <hi>10th</hi> Commandment, <hi>Thou shalt not covet.</hi> If therefore sin be a <hi>transgression of the Law,</hi> which is the rule by which we judge of the Rectitude and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, not only of actions, but likewise of Intentions, Thoughts and the inclinations of the Soul; then this concupiscence and proneness to Sin, must it self likewise be a Sin.</p>
                  <p>I know against this it is said by the <hi>Socin.</hi> and <hi>Remonst.</hi> and particularly by <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <hi>Limb.</hi> That the first propensions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62459:77"/> of the Soul towards sin, do not come within the intention of the Law, and consequently are not prohibited by it, except in these two cases. <hi>1st.</hi> When they are of long continuance, the mind dwelling upon such desires, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing in them. Or <hi>2dly,</hi> When they are joyned with the full consent of the will, and a deliberate purpose to put them in execution.</p>
                  <p>Now let us a little consider, what must be the natural and unavoidable consequences of this Exposition. First, from hence it must follow, that these original commotions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensions to Sin, being things purely natural, and therefore not prohibited by the Law, ought not to be resisted, so as to be destroyed, or rooted out of the Soul. Hitherto we have bin taught to believe, and it hath been given us as a rule to be observed in the exposition of the Commandments, that whenever God forbids the <hi>Fact,</hi> he likewise forbids the <hi>Causes, and Principles,</hi> which have a direct and necessary tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the production of that effect. And such are those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations before mentioned, every man when he Sins, <hi>being drawn away by his own Lust and enticed by it,</hi> James 1. 14. And therefore, whereas formerly we were told, that we should <hi>principiis obstare,</hi> hinder the beginnings of Sin, the first moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards it, and if it were possible to strangle them in the Birth: this new Casuist will tell us that we neither need, nor indeed ought to pray or struggle against them, <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Primo hi motus non sunt in nostra potestate, imo nonnunquam quo acrius iis obsistimus, eo vehementius illis infestamur. Secundo tantum abest ut vitia sint, ut sint materia exercendae virtutis,</hi> &amp;c.</note> for two reasons; First, because being natural they are absolutely out of our power, and therefore all resistance is but labor lost and in vain, it is like striving against the stream, which when it is dammed up it swells the higher, grows more furious by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and at length bears down all before it.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge indeed, that these inclinations are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely in our power, but however we may and must oppose them, and by opposing, we shall thro the assistance of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62459:77"/> grace of Christ, restrain and moderate them; in short we must fight against them, tho we cannot hope for an absolute and entire conquest in this life: we must pray, and strive, and labor, and <hi>our Labor shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> No, saith <hi>Limb.</hi> have a care what you do, all attempts of this nature are not only unprofitable but dangerous, for <hi>2dly,</hi> You must know there is a closer connexion between virtue, and those inclinations to Sin, than most people are aware of. These latter being as it were the seed from whence virtuous habits arise, or at least the matter necessary for the exercise of them. In short, Virtue without them either could not subsist, or at least were a very useless and insignificant thing. <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Haec facultas, cum sit naturalis, extingui nec potest, nec debet, cum sit mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria exercendae virtutis,</hi> Id. Lib. 5. Cap. 15. Sect. 3. <hi>And that we may not think that he accounted concupiscence only the accidental occasion of the exercise of Vertue, (in which sense bad manners are said to be the cause of good Laws) he tells us that they are the proper direct subject of it. Materia per se virtutis exercendae, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus requiritur subjectum quod illis motibus corripi potest, ut sit Idoneum ad obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam praestandam.</hi> Ejusd. Cap.

                     </note>
                     <hi>Therefore these inclinations to sin are such, as neither can, nor ought to be extinguished.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> From hence it must follow that concupiscence being natural, as it ought not to be destroyed, so need we not be troubled about it; for what is not sinful, need not be the subject of our humiliations, nor even of a general repentance.

Now whether these and the like doctrines which are the unavoidable consequences of this Opinion, that concupiscence is no sin, do not tend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all piety, tho the Abettors of it do not only pretend, but may really design to promote it, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all, for <hi>3dly,</hi> From hence it farther fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that these evil inclinations, (so I make bold to call all inclinations towards evil) being natural, must challenge God to be their Author, who is undoubtedly the Author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And if so, then a man may be said to be <hi>tempted of God, when he is drawn away by his own Lust, and enticed;</hi> according to that known maxim, <hi>causa causae est causa causati,</hi> which holds good in all <hi>necessary causes,</hi> and such is concupiscence, in this case, which necessarily and unavoidably tempts and seduces men to sin. The consent indeed is a mans own voluntary Act, and therefore even in unregenerate men, not so absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. But the first motions are purely natural, if we believe <hi>Limb.</hi> and the <hi>temptations</hi> arising thence to commit actual sins are unavoidable. Therefore since the temptation proceeds from the faculty, as the Faculty proceeds from God; according to the order and connexion of necessary causes, the temptation, upon this supposition, must likewise come from God. Indeed <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>Lastly, I shall use but one argument more to shew the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of this Opinion, and that is, if Concupiscence be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, it must be found in <hi>Christ himself,</hi> who took upon him our whole nature, with all the infirmities of it, sin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Now to say that there was in Christ a proneness and inclination to sin, <hi>Motus concupiscentiae, &amp; carnis titillatio, ex oblato objecto carni grato excitata,</hi> as <hi>Limb.</hi> before defined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, which he made to be natural; is not only a false, but an impious, and indeed a <hi>Blasphemous affirmation.</hi>

                        <hi>In Christo fuit talis natura, in qua suit affectus repugnans voluntati, nec ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is fuit peccatum, quia assensus seu voluntas non subsecuta est</hi> Jo. Geister apud Pelt. <hi>Concupiscentia non est peccatum, nec reliquiae peccati originis; cum uti an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea vidimus, in primis nostris parentibus fuerit ante lapsum, &amp; in ipso Domino Jesu.</hi> Limb. Lib. 5. Cap. 15. Sect. 13.</note> And yet this must be the consequence of this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, there were in Christ himself, (who was as other men are, made up of sense as well as reason) <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Appetites,</hi> which were purely natural and consequently blameless. For whatever is grateful to sense, is not <hi>eo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and for that reason displeasing to God. In short, when our desires, I mean those which arise from sense, are placed upon a <hi>due object,</hi> and do not otherwise exceed their <hi>just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> then are they innocent and harmless; and such were they in our blessed Savior, who could not (except it were very falsly and maliciously) either be accused of any actual sin, or of any inclination to the commission of it.</p>
                  <p>I know against all this that hath bin said upon this head, it will be replyed, that some Fathers, and Learned School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were of Opinion, that those first motions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and the inclinations towards unlawful objects, could not properly be accounted sins. I <hi>Ans.</hi> That tho they might shew some doubt about the name, yet they made none about the thing. For they do readily acknowledge, that this part
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62459:79"/> of Original Sin, is a moral deflection from the Law of our Creation. That it contains in it, an aversion from God, and a conversion to the Creature; that it is opposite not only to the perfection of Gods Law, but to the purity of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit; that it pollutes our nature, and consequently is the object of Gods Aversation, and should be so of ours. Which is all that is intended by us, when we call it Sin, and all that is worth the contending for. The rest is but a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The last thing that remains to be done, is to prove that this depravation of our nature is the effect and consequence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sin.</hi> And this the Scriptures plainly declare to us, as was shewed before; when they let us know, <hi>That by one man,</hi> viz.

But if this Scripture-account of the Origine of Evil, doth not please our Adversaries, what course will they direct us to, to find it out. Must we have recourse to the Ancient but justly exploded Opinions of Heathens and Hereticks? is this corruption owing to an evil Daemon; to the malignant influences of the Stars; to the perversity of matter; or lastly to that pernicious, restless, quarrelsome principle, discord, and antipathy out of which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Friendship and Harmony, the world (as many <note n="2" place="bottom">Heraclitus, Empedocles, Pythagoras, Plato apud Plut. de I side &amp; Osir.</note> of the ancient Philosophers imagined) was made?

So that we need not fear the dissent of any, from this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth, who preserve a due regard for the Inspiration and divine Authority of the Scriptures, a just reverence for the determinations of the Ancient and Catholick Church, and lastly, an esteeme for the unanimous Confessions of all the Reformed Churches, without exception of any one of them; and particularly for that of this <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus finished what I had to say concerning man in his <hi>lapsed and degenerate state:</hi> I come now to speak of his <hi>Redemption and Recovery</hi> by Christ. And here according to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62459:82"/> the method before laid down, I shall first give an account of what the Scriptures inform us in this matter; and then second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of what alterations <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers have made, in this great and <hi>Fundamental doctrine</hi> of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>In speaking to the former, I must enquire into the <hi>great end</hi> and reason of Christs coming into the world: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>what way and means</hi> he did procure and accomplish that end of his coming. First if we enquire into the <hi>next and immediate end</hi> of our blessed Saviours coming into the World, and without a respect to which he would not have bin sent into it; the Scriptures will inform us, that it was for the <hi>redemption and reconciliation</hi> of all Mankind, the whole Mass as descending from <hi>Adam,</hi> who were universally without exception of any, under the displeasure of God; obnoxious to his justice, lyable to the penalty of the Law which they had transgressed; which was both a <hi>temporal death,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise an <hi>eternal separation</hi> from the presence of God, in whose favour is life; as was said before.</p>
                  <p>Here are two things to be made out, First that all men, I mean all meer men, the whole posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and consequently under the displeasure of God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to his justice. Now this the Scripture is so express and punctual in, that one would think there should be no room left for doubt or cavil. St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 3. 9. tells us, <hi>That he had proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they were all under Sin. That every mouth must be stopped,</hi> when charged by God, having nothing to say in vindication of themselves, <hi>the whole world being guilty before him,</hi> v. 19. And in one word, <hi>That all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God,</hi> v. 23. Not to repeat those other places in the 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> which we formerly cited; viz. <hi>That by the disohedience of one, many, or all men became sinners.</hi> v. 19. And that <hi>death passed upon all men, because all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> v. 12. These universal forms of speech being of that Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as to comprehend all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any: Jew, and Gentile, Bond and Free, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Young and Old, one with another.</p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62459:83"/>
                  <p>Thus the Scripture hath <hi>concluded all under Sin, Gal.</hi> 3. 22. I hope I need not farther prove, that all men being thus sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were under the displeasure of God, and obnoxious to his justice: for the immediate and necessary effect of Sin is guilt, and Guilt is nothing else, but an obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. From whence it follows, that all men being born sinners, bringing along with them corrupt and <hi>depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> must likewise be <hi>by nature Children of wrath,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> That Christ came into the world, to redeem men from that deplorable and miserable condition, into which sin had brought them; which he did by making an atonement for their sins, and thereby reconciling God and man together. And of this we have so full, as well as so plain an account in the New Testament, that the Gospel is from thence styled the <hi>Word and Ministry of reconciliation,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. viz. <hi>That God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them.</hi> This being the reason of his taking upon him our nature, that he <hi>might make reconciliation for the sins of the people,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. This was the great instance of Gods love to the World, <hi>That he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> Jo. 3. 16. You see in what condition all the world were left, if God had not in great compassion sent his Son to their rescue, they must inevitably and irrecoverably have perished, and have bin lost for ever.</p>
                  <p>And what God the Father thus did, is likewise ascribed to the Son himself: for whatsoever was thus done for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of lost man, was by his own voluntary consent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; <hi>Who gave himself for our Sins,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. That is, to deliver us from the Guilt, as well as the Dominion of them; or as the same Apostle expresses it, Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himself, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good works.</hi> Where we have an account of two things, First of the reason of Christs giving himself for us, or the next and immediate end
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62459:83"/> of his coming into the World, <hi>viz. to redeem</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of what hath bin thus said, this is the summe. That all those for whose sake Christ came into the World, and took upon him the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. an human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he received by propagation from <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>whom as to the flesh</hi> he was descended: or, that those for whom he <hi>gave himself,</hi> viz. to Death and the bitter passions of the Cross, were Sinners, Enemies to God, obnoxious to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and therefore stood in need of a reconciliation. But Christ gave himself, and come down from Heaven, <hi>for the sake
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62459:84"/> of the whole world,</hi> Jo. 3. 16. by which phrase is meant <hi>Genus Humanum,</hi> all mankind: under which are comprehended all meere men of whatsoever Age, Sex, or Condition: <hi>wise or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, Infants as well as persons of riper years, men and women:</hi> all these making up, and being parts of the Would: God by giving his Son, and clothing him in our nature, having given an instance of his superlative Love, not only to this or that particular man, this or that sort of men, (tho some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons have a more eminent and peculiar share in it than others; to whom the benefits of Christs coming, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is only applyed; but that is for other reasons not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful here to be mentioned) but <hi>to all mankind,</hi> who stood in need of him, and without whom they must universally, and inevitably have perished.</p>
                  <p>Hence he is said <hi>to have suffered for us,</hi> indefinitely, 1 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>To have born our Sins in his body on the Tree, (i. e.</hi> He bore the punishment of them on the Cross,) <hi>That we being dead unto Sin, should Live unto Righteousness,</hi> v. 24. <hi>To have died for Sinners,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. who by <hi>being Sinners,</hi> were <hi>likewise Enemies,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wanted a reconciliation, which was purchased by his death, v. 10. <hi>He gave his life a Ransom for many,</hi> Mat. 20. 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 45. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> being here to be interpreted in the same sense, as it is used by the Apost. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. where it is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as was formerly observed. But if these Phrases do not seem full enough, the Scripture furnishes us with others more punctual and express, assuring us that <hi>Christ dyed for all</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, 2. Cor. 5. 14. <hi>Gave himself a Ransom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 6. <hi>That he tasted death for every man,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. And in one word, <hi>That he is the propitiation for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> 1 Jo. 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>From these two premisses thus laid down, this conclusion must necessarily and unavoidably be inferred, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>all the World,</hi> all Mankind, and every individual person, were Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, under the displeasure of God, and the condemnation of the Law, and as such were looked upon, and esteemed by God, <hi>Antecedently to his Decree of sending his Son into the World;</hi> who for that reason came into it, to make a reconciliation of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62459:85"/> them all; to restore them to the favour of God, which by their Sins they had forfeited. Indeed this reconciliation is not available to all; but this arises from their non-performance of the Conditions, required to entitle them to the actual participation of it: and tho we must acknowledge that the <hi>application of pardon,</hi> as well as the <hi>purchase of it,</hi> is performed by Christ; yet it is not done in the same way, and by the same means, the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> the purchase of reconciliation requiring something to be done on Christs part, the former, <hi>viz.</hi> the Application of it, requiring certain conditions on ours: the one being the effect of <hi>Christs Priestly,</hi> as the other is of his <hi>Regal Office;</hi> which are perpetually confounded by the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now against all this, which hath bin plainly deduced out of the Scriptures, the <hi>Socinians</hi> on the other side with great vehemence contend, that Christ was not sent into the World, to reconcile it; That is, as we have stated it, to purchase the favour of God, and remission of Sins for Mankind. And that for these two Reasons, <hi>1st,</hi> Because, <hi>all Mankind</hi> were not Sinners, and consequently stood in no need of pardon and reconciliation. <hi>Adam</hi> hurt none but himself by his disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>the Mass</hi> as descending from him, was not <hi>tainted and leaven'd</hi> with any infection: Men being now born into the world, as <hi>Adam</hi> was at first Created, in a <hi>State of Innocence.</hi> So that there was no need to redeem such from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, who were not liable to it upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their own actual Sins, and therefore not liable at all. And this is the case of all Infants, and was, or at least might be the case of several adult persons if we believe these men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Tho all men had bin <hi>Sinners</hi> (as they who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted actual Sins certainly were) yet there was <note n="1" place="bottom">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62459:85"/> Christs coming to reconcile them to God; who was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with men for their iniquities, nor provoked thereby to shew any marks of his displeasure towards them. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such Attribute in God as <hi>vindictive justice,</hi> (which is a quality fit only for passionate and revengeful men) which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclined him to punish, or hindred him to pardon them without a <hi>compensation</hi> made for the wrongs and injuries done to his Authority, by the violation of his Laws. In short, the only obstacle of reconciliation was on mens side, if they would but forsake their Sins for the future, what was past should make no breach of kindness between them. He was so far from denying them <hi>his favour,</hi> that he courted <hi>their friendship;</hi> and tho he were the person injured, yet he desired no other <hi>compensation</hi> but that they would lay aside their enmity; and, in one word, he would be abundantly <hi>satisfied,</hi> if they would vouchsafe to be reconciled to him.</p>
                  <p>If you enquire what reasons then there were that moved God to send Christ into the World, they will tell you there were several. And among others they instance principally in these three following. First, this was done in a <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condescention</hi> to the follies and weakness of mankind, and particularly with relation to one impious and superstitious custome, which had long, and in a manner universally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the world before Christs coming into it. For so it was, that those persons who had in their life time bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their valour, or had otherways bin useful and serviceable to mankind; after their Death were usually <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now in reference to these several <hi>Socinian hypotheses,</hi> we must acknowledge that they are very artificially contrived by them, in order to impose upon weak and unwary Readers, who may be apt at the same time to swallow down truth and falsehood, which are here (<hi>in order to amuse men and divert
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62459:87"/> them from the consideration of the true ends of our Saviour's coming into the World</hi>) very speciously and with great cunning, twisted and joyned together. And tho they all deserve and must have a particular consideration, yet at present I shall only make my remarks upon the first of them, and wave the consideration of the other two, till I come to discourse of the <hi>Death and Sufferings of Christ,</hi> at which time they will more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be considered.</p>
                  <p>As to the first therefore of these Hypotheses, tho we must with infinite satisfaction and thankfulness acknowledge the Mediation of our blessed Savior now in Heaven, who is sat down at the right hand of his Father, <hi>where he ever lives to make intercession for us,</hi> yet we can by no means admit of this <hi>Socinian</hi> Account of it, and that chiefly for these 3 Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it seems to be a great disparagement to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian institution,</hi> to derive the admirable contrivance for the Salvation of Mankind, from the <hi>foolish and absurd</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men, and the wicked and superstitious customs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent upon them; we cannot but with all due reverence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the infinite <hi>condescension of God</hi> in his dealings with men; whereby he is pleased to pass by their weaknesses, to excuse their follies, to accomodate himself to their weak and shallow conceptions, in the discoveries which he is pleased to make of himself. But I doubt whether it may be warrantably affirmed, that in any of his Religious <hi>Institutions</hi> he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodated himself to their foolish and wicked Imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps against this it may be objected, that many of the Ceremonies and Rites prescribed to the Jews by Gods own appointment, were such, as for some Ages before had bin <hi>practiced in the Heathen World;</hi> several of which in complyance with the <hi>weakness and passions</hi> of that perverse people, he thought fit to adopt into his own service and worship. To which I Ans. That admitting this to be true, (which yet most Learned men will not allow to be so,) it will not come up to the point; unless it can be farther proved, that those ancient rites pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Heathens were in themselves unlawful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and that God in complyance with the Apprehensions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62459:88"/> of the Jews about such profane practices, prescribed something of the like nature to be performed by them; This being the case of the mediation of <hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Demi-Gods</hi> among the Heathens; which was a profane and Idolatrous practice, highly dishonourable to God, repugnant to Piety, and such as had almost banished all just notions of God, and all the right way of worshiping him out of the World. No doubt God might have made choice of any innocent, and much more any ancient and laudable rites and usages, (tho they had bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to superstitious purposes) and have incorporated them into his own Religion and Worship. But to say that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted any thing as a part of his own service, in complyance with any custom in its own nature Impious, I think cannot be affirmed, without a great and dangerous reflection upon the <hi>holyness and righteousness of God</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">And this is acknowledged by Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> who is the great promoter of this Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Laws and Rites, were derived from the like institutions and practices of the Heathens. <hi>Cum Deus gentem sanctam conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp; collapsum numinis sui cultum ad nitorem &amp; puritatem pristinam restituere statuisset, ritus omnes</hi> aut sua natura corruptos; <hi>aut impuris Daemonis Orgiis ita conjunctos ut lustrari non poterant, penitus abolevit; quicquid erat in cultu olim re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepto <gap reason="foreign">

De Leg. Hebr. Lib. 1. Cap. 10.</note> Add to this, that it seems to be no ordinary disparagement to his wisdom; which, as the Scriptures assure us, hath bin so admirably displayed in the methods found out for our Salvation, that Men and Angels <hi>are justly astonished, and stand amazed in the Contemplation of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But according to this <hi>Socinian Hypothesis,</hi> it amounts to no more than this, that God having resolved to put an end to a foolish and superstitious custome which had too long bin practised, instead of those Demi Gods which the <hi>fancy and fears of superstitious men</hi> had consecrated, he did substitute another eminently good and virtuous person in their room, to whom they might lawfully make their addresses, and whom for the future they might look upon to be their great <hi>Patron and Advocate.</hi> What is there in all this which may be thought to exceed the invention of a finite, or even an humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62459:88"/> We know what things of this nature have bin invented, and practised in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet there is none of us, I think, that stands in any great admiration either of the <hi>wisdome, or piety of the contrivance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> Let it be granted, that God in condescention to the weakness of men, should think fit to gratifie them in some of their absurd and impious apprehensions, (which yet I think can hardly be allowed, without derogating from the <hi>purity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Christian Institution, which is admirably calculated <hi>for the extirpation</hi> of all foolish, and superstitious notions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires out of the minds of men, but by no meanes designed to <hi>cherish and comply</hi> with them) yet we cannot without great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety affirm, that God would encourage them in any <hi>sinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices:</hi> but rather would divert their inclinations upon fit and proper objects. Since they must have <hi>a mediator,</hi> he would substitute a <hi>lawful one,</hi> to whom they might <hi>safely and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> make their addresses and supplications; and so by his mighty power overrule the desires of men, and <hi>bring good out of their evil Intentions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But so he hath not done in this case, according to the <hi>Socinians;</hi> but by placing <hi>one man</hi> in the roome of others, hath only <hi>exchanged</hi> the Idolatry, but hath not <hi>prevented</hi> the practice of it: for to give divine worship to <hi>a creature,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, is downright Idolatry. To say that Christ was an extraordinary, or if you please <hi>a divine man,</hi> will not alter the case. This may make it a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and excusable Idolatry; but Idolatry it is still. For tho Christ hath, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, <hi>Infinitely</hi> the advantage of other men; yet being but a man, he must come <hi>infinitely</hi> short of the divine perfections: and therefore divine worship and adoration cannot be payd to him, without a bold and <hi>Sacrilegious Invasion</hi> of that right, which God claims as his sole prerogative; and which he hath said, <hi>nay which he hath sworn, he will not give to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, admit these desires in men were <hi>innocent,</hi> and the practice consequent to it, not only <hi>blameless but commendable,</hi> yet this account of <hi>Sclichtingius</hi> were not to be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62459:89"/> it stints and limits the efficacy of Christs death and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, to certain times and persons; which yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture assures us was of that extent, as to reach <hi>all Ages,</hi> and <hi>all Men</hi> that have bin in the World.</p>
                  <p>If therefore Christ was sent into the world in condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the weakness, and in complyance with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and practices of men, in the worship and mediation of <hi>Heroes and Demi-Gods:</hi> it must from hence follow, that these apprehensions, and these practices, were <hi>Antecedent</hi> to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and decree of God, to send his son into the world; it being an undoubted truth, that whatever is the <hi>cause,</hi> or the <hi>occasion</hi> of any purpose or institution, must in order of nature be <hi>Antecedent</hi> to that institution. And if so, then all those who lived before these <hi>Idolatrous practices,</hi> grew com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and universal, forasmuch as they lived before the coming of Christ was decreed, or perhaps so much as thought of, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were, nor indeed could be regarded by God in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and consequently had no share in the benefits of Christs coming, nor did partake in any of those ends which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished by it.</p>
                  <p>Now how many <hi>Years,</hi> or perhaps <hi>Ages past,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how many thousands, or myriades of men lived and dyed, before this Idolatrous practice <hi>began,</hi> and much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <hi>prevailed</hi> in the world, is impossible to determine. But be the number of the men what it will, this is certain; that none of them were, or could be regarded by God the Father, when he took the resolution of sending his son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, if this were the occasion or cause of it. Now this plainly contradicts the Scriptures, which assure us (as was said before) that God gave his son, for the <hi>sake of the whole World,</hi> and every individual member of the same. I know that this inference which I have made, with relation to those persons who lived and dyed before this practice of Idolatry prevail'd, is esteemed a matter of no ill consequence in the opinion of a <hi>Socinian,</hi> and therefore that they will not be afraid to own it: but on the other hand they earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it, as for an undoubted; and important truth; that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62459:89"/> the virtue of Christs sacrifice had no <note n="1" place="bottom">Socin. de Christo Serv. cap. 26.</note>
                     <hi>retrospect;</hi> that it did affect no sinners who lived before him, because it neither could, nor was design'd to expiate any sins, but those that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after his appearance among men. But I hope others will have more honorable apprehensions of the virtue and dignity of <hi>Christs sacrifice,</hi> in which their own <hi>particular safety</hi> and that of the <hi>whole world</hi> is wrapped up.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> were indeed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, in making the end of Christs coming to be in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>one or two</hi> foolish apprehensions of men, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ill practices that were occasioned thereby: But that the <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  <p>For first, all <hi>Adult persons</hi> who in any Age of the world,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62459:90"/> lived without the commission of <hi>actual Sin,</hi> had no need of this redemption.

                  <p>So that in short, tho it should be acknowledged that all <hi>Adult persons</hi> are actually sinners, and therefore want <hi>pardon and reconciliation;</hi> yet according to them, Infants stand in no need of <hi>a Savior</hi> upon that account, there being in this sense, no Minors, <hi>no Babes in Christ.</hi> Now this Opinion of the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Rem.</hi> is plainly repugnant to the express words, and to the whole Tenor, and design of the Gospel; which informs us that Christ is the Savior of none but sinners. This being the reason of his name, why he was called <hi>Jesus</hi> a Savior, as we have it assigned by the Angel that appeared to <hi>Joseph</hi> 1 Math. 21. <hi>For he shall save his people from their Sins. They who were whole had no need of</hi> this divine <hi>Physician,</hi> who came for the sake of the <hi>Sick and Infirm;</hi> and was sent <hi>not to call the Righteous but sinners to Repentance,</hi> Math. 9. 13. for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>he was made flesh,</hi> Jo. 1. 14. Or, <hi>was made partaker of flesh and blood,</hi> as other men are, that in it he might dy for us, <hi>and thro death destroy him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. And that we may not think that any were partakers of this benefit, that is, rescued from the dominion of Death and the Empire of the Devil, who were not first redeemed from the Guilt of Sin: In the 16 and 17 ver. the Apostle tells us, <hi>that he took upon him an humane nature,</hi> (styled
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62459:92"/> there <hi>the seed of Abraham,</hi> because he had it by propagation from <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom as to the flesh he was descended,) that in it he might be capable of executing the Office of a Priest, and thereby <hi>make reconciliation for the sins of the People.</hi> And what he saith here, he repeats again (tho in other words, yet to the same purpose) Heb. 9. 26. <hi>That Christ now in the end of the world hath appeared,</hi> and the end of this apppearance was, that he might <hi>put away sin by the Sacrifice of himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the same reason, when God designed to supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Jewish Sacrifices, and to put an end to them, by a more noble one which was typifyed and represented by them; he sent his son into the world, cloathing him in our nature, having <hi>prepared and fitted a Body for him,</hi> to this very purpose, that in it he might be capable of being a Sacrifice; and by this oblation of himself once for all, make one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral atonement and expiation for the sins of the whole world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. 10. For having made one complete sufficient Sacrifice for sins, <hi>he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. <hi>Having obtained eternal Redemption for us,</hi> Heb. 9. 12. Thus if you enquire why this <hi>Lamb of God</hi> came into the world; <hi>Jo. Baptist</hi> will tell us that it was <hi>to take away the sins of it,</hi> Jo. 1. 29. If you put the question, why he <hi>shed his blood;</hi> he himself will return the Answer, <hi>that it was for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins,</hi> Mat. 27 28.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, he has by his death purchased for us more than pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> eternal life. But then I say none shall be finally <hi>saved</hi> by Christ, in the next world, who were not first <hi>pardoned</hi> by him in this, this being the first step to that great Salvation, and the first degree of it.</p>
                  <p>In short, I suppose it will be granted by all, that none can be admitted into Heaven, but those who are in favor with God; but according to the tenor of the Gospel, none can be admitted to his favor but those for whom <hi>Christ dyed;</hi> Christ dyed for none <hi>but sinners, who was manifested to take away our sins,</hi> 1 Jo. 3. 5. <hi>He came into the world to save sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. None else wanted his coming, or were regarded by him when he undertook this errand, any more then the Angels;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62459:93"/> for as he himself assures us (and he sure best knew the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his own undertakings) <hi>He came to seek and save only that which was lost,</hi> Luke 19. 10. Therefore to bring both parts of the Argument together, those who are no sinners, either must not be admitted into Heaven, or, they must come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some other way than by the assistance and mediation of Christ; which is plainly to give us a <hi>New Gospel,</hi> a New method of Salvation, different from that which the Old Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ hath revealed to us. And so I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, the second thing proposed to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>way and means,</hi> whereby Christ procured that Reconciliation which was the end of his coming into the world; and this we are informed was by his <hi>death and sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may understand this matter aright, we must know that the Scripture every where sets forth the anger and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God against sin and sinners, as in very plain, so likewise in very Emphaticall terms: representing him as their <hi>Enemy,</hi> as one highly <hi>provoked</hi> and incensed by their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore resolved to punish them, and thereby to vindicate his authority, and to rescue it from the contempt cast upon it by the violation of his Laws. Thus we are told, that sin occasions a <hi>separation and division between God and us;</hi> and that not only on mans part, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> state this matter, as if the aversion were only on that side; but that it creates an aversation on Gods part against the sinner. For before man offended he was in favor with God, but now sin makes the breach. <hi>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you,</hi> Esay. 59. 2. This is an Argument of his high displeasure, he will not look upon the sinner, but turns his face from him, as men use to do from an object that creates loathing and detestation.</p>
                  <p>And another Prophet assigns the reason of this aversion on Gods part, because <hi>He is a God of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Heb. 1. 13. Hence he is said not only to hate the evil ways and doings of wicked men, but to abhor their persons, and with high disdain to reject even their <hi>services,</hi> for the sake of their <hi>Sins,</hi> Esay. 1. 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that we may not think,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62459:93"/> that this denotes only the opposition that is between the righteousness of God, and the impieties of men, which as the <hi>Socin.</hi> acknowledge are contrary indeed to his Holyness, and therefore do create a displeasure in him, but yet without any intention to punish men for them; the Scriptures fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put us in mind of another Attribute in God, viz. <hi>his Justice,</hi> whose proper business and office is to revenge the wrongs and injuries done to his Holyness, by them who live in opposition to it; which as we have elsewhere shewed (<hi>part 1. p.</hi> 28.) puts him into a state of hostility against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and naturally inclines and moves him to punish them; tho the Egress of this justice in the actual infliction of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, may be subject to the determinations of his own will and pleasure.</p>
                  <p>But to preclude all hopes of impunity from sinners, God hath in his word, made a publick and solemn declaration of his pleasure in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lination,</hi> and his Law his <hi>Intention</hi> to punish sinners. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Law of nature did so far inform men of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that they were convinced in their minds, that they who did things contrary to it <hi>were worthy of Death,</hi> Rom. 1. 31. But the revealed Law hath expressly and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively denounced death to the transgressors of it. <hi>In the day thou eatest thou shalt surely dye,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. And that we may not think that this threatning concerned only the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the first Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, we find the same penalty annexed to the violation of all other Laws, <hi>Cursed is he that confirmeth not all the words of the Law to do them,</hi> Deut. 27. 26. or as the Apost. expresses it, <hi>that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. Hence it is that all wicked men are said to be obnoxious to the wrath of God, as soon as they are born, for by being born sinners, and bringing <hi>defiled natures</hi> along with them into the world, they <hi>become by nature Children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. And are much more so by their actual sins; for while they go on in their <hi>hardness and impenitence, they treasure up
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62459:94"/> to themselves wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. and what is thus <hi>revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness,</hi> Rom. 1. 18. is particularly denounced as the doome of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: <hi>He that believeth not on the Son hath not Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Jo. 3. 36.</p>
                  <p>Against which the sinner can have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, because he hath but the just fruits of his own doings, <hi>The wages of sin being Death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. <hi>It being a most equal and righteous thing with God to render tribulation to sinners,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 6. Or as the same Apost. expresses this more fully in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish upon every Soul of man that doth Evil,</hi> (without any exception, or hopes of escape) <hi>of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile,</hi> Rom. 2. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>From all which it is evident, that if we consider God with relation to sinners (and are willing to govern our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of him by the plain declarations▪ of the Scripture, and the discovery which he hath made of himself there, and not by our own foolish and absurd imaginations) we must look upon him as one highly angry and displeased with wicked men, provoked to that degree as to be resolved upon punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and every thing standing in the way of the sinner, to obstruct the passages to favor and pardon, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Holyness of God,</hi> his <hi>Justice,</hi> his <hi>Laws,</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> his <hi>Honor,</hi> his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity:</hi> so that let him look which way he will, there remains nothing for him, but <hi>a fearfull looking for of judgment and fiery indignation to devour him as an adversary</hi> to his maker, Heb. 10. 27. And they that are Gods adversaries, he will be sure to be theirs with a witness, (the enmity being reciprocal) who claims vengeance as his prerogative; <hi>it belongeth to me, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense saith the Lord,</hi> Heb. 10. 30. It must therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be a <hi>fearful thing to fall into his hands▪</hi> but how can the sinner possibly avoid it? the Law hath perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily threatned death to the transgressors of it, <hi>thou shalt sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye;</hi> and <hi>we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God; there being none righteous, no not one,</hi> Rom. 3. 10. What method now can be thought of to secure the sinner from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62459:94"/> that condemnation, which the Law hath threatned, and his sins have deserved. We are <hi>all become guilty before God,</hi> and guilt is an obligation to punishment, and punished we must be, except we can think of some way to cancel that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In short God is Angry, his Justice is provoked, and we shall certainly feel the terrible effects of his displeasure, except we can find out some expedient, to pacify his wrath, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his justice, and thereby to purchase his favor, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God and us together. But neither men nor Angels could have contrived any such method, as the wisdom of God hath found out, and which the Scriptures have revealed to us; which inform us that Gods anger is appeased, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and pardon purchased, but purchased at a dear rate, <hi>viz.</hi> by the death and sufferings of the son of God. So saith the Apost. <hi>we are reconciled to God by the death of his son,</hi> Rom. 5. 10. And because Christ by dying shed his blood for us, we find the Scriptures ascribing a peculiar efficacy to this blood, in order to procure the favor of God, and remission of sins for us. This is called <hi>the Blood of the New Testament which was shed for the remission of sins,</hi> Math. 26. 28. <hi>We have redemption through his Blood, the forgiveness of Sins,</hi> Eph. 1. 7. <hi>God hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation,</hi> but it is <hi>through Faith in his Blood,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. <hi>We are justified by his Blood,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Which cleanseth us from all Sins,</hi> 1 Jo. 1. 7. <hi>We have redemption through his Blood,</hi> Col. 1. 14. <hi>The Church of God</hi> is said to be <hi>the purchase of his Blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28. And in one word, <hi>He hath washed us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. <hi>Quae toties repetita manifeste ostendunt, proprium aliquem at peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arem effectum huic morti ac sanguini tribuendum,</hi> as <hi>Grot.</hi> rightly observes, <hi>de Satisf. p.</hi> 13. All which being so often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, evidently shews, that some more than ordinary virtue and energy belongs to the Death of Christ, whereby it hath a peculiar influence in order to procure the <hi>pardon of our Sins,</hi> and the <hi>Justification of our Persons:</hi> and withal being so frequently inculcated by the Apostles upon all occasions, again and again, it must farther be an evident argument, that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great and high importance, forasmuch as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62459:95"/> peace, and our future happyness absolutely depend upon it.</p>
                  <p>But now if it shall be farther asked, how the blood of Christ comes to be of that peculiar force, as thus to purchase par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconciliation for Mankind; I Ans. the reason of it is, because our blessed Savior, by dying and shedding his blood, underwent that <note n="1" place="bottom">I do not mean exactly <hi>Idem,</hi> the very same punishment, but that which was equivalent.</note>
                     <hi>punishment,</hi> and submitted to that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> which our sins had otherwise rendred us inevitably obnoxious to: and this being in it self a <hi>sufficient compensation</hi> made to the justice of God, for the affronts and injuries of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to his Authority by the violation of his Laws; and likewise being <hi>accepted</hi> of by him as such; it must from hence necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and naturally be effectual, to procure for us pardon and impunity. Now this being a matter of great consequence, upon which the whole stress of the controversy between us and our Adversaries leans and rests; I shall a little farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon it, and endeavor to make out these two things. <hi>1st,</hi> That Christ dyed <hi>for our sakes,</hi> and that not only as it signifies, for our benefit and advantage, but in <hi>our roome and stead. 2dly,</hi> That his Death, was in it self a sufficient compensation to the Justice of God, and accepted of by him for such.</p>
                  <p>First, That Christ dyed for us are the plain words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>he gave himself for us,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Eph. 5. 25. <hi>he dyed for us,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 10, <hi>he dyed for all,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. And this not only in general for our good, but he <hi>was delivered up for our offences,</hi> Rom. 4. 25. <hi>he dyed for our Sins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3. So to the same purpose, and for the same reason, he is said <hi>to dye for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. And it is mentioned as the great instance of Gods love to us, that <hi>whilst we were yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Christ dyed for us,</hi> ver. 10. of the same Chap. All which phrases of dying for sins, and sinners, plainly denote to us, that sin in those places is not to be considered as <hi>the final,</hi> but as the <hi>impulsive and meritorious</hi> cause of Christs death.</p>
                  <p>And this is so evident, that even <hi>Socinus</hi> himself and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, notwithstanding the many shifts and cavils used by them to avoid the conviction of this truth, are yet, whether
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62459:95"/> they will or no forced to acknowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> That the death of Christ was necessary, not only for the destruction of the dominion of sin, but likewise for removal of the guilt of it: upon which account, they are willing to call it an <note n="1" place="bottom">

First, by <hi>declaring pardon</hi> for past Sins. Secondly, By giving us a <hi>right and title</hi> to it, and thereby <hi>mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obliging</hi> God to grant it.

                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62459:96"/> our blessed Savior conferring and bestowing pardon upon Sinners, by virtue of that power and authority with which he is now invested in Heaven, and which was given him as the reward of his obedience and sufferings. All this at first view, (as one might be apt to think) would amount to a pretty handsome acknowledgment of this great truth; they seeming to express themselves <hi>roundly and fully,</hi> and to come up to the point: but when we come more narrowly to examin parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and to make those deductions and defalcations, which these men by explaining and limiting their own assertions, think reasonable to be allowed; the sum total of these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, when they come to be cast up, will be found to amount to one <hi>large, round, empty insignificant Cypher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first the <hi>declaration</hi> of pardon, is not the <hi>procuring</hi> of it, neither is it of any force to do so. If Christs death did no more, then it is certain that remission of sins was purchased or procured some other way, as being antecedent to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which for that reason renders it impossible, that either it should be the <hi>occasion,</hi> or <hi>the cause</hi> of the pardon of sin.

At this rate the <hi>Redemption of the world</hi> might as truly and properly be ascribed to the <hi>Birth of Christ,</hi> as it is to his death: it being as absolutely necessary
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62459:99"/> that he should be <hi>born</hi> before he could <hi>dye,</hi> as that he should <hi>dye</hi> before he could <hi>rise and ascend</hi> into Heaven, and present himself to his Father there.</p>
                  <p>But how comes it then to pass, that the Scripture speaks in such lofty and magnificent terms, of the <hi>dignity and energy</hi> of Christs blood? <hi>viz.</hi> that we are <hi>Justified, Redeemed, Purified, Saved</hi> by his blood. How comes it to lay so great a stress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>cross of Christ,</hi> as that the Gospel should from thence be styled the <hi>doctrine of the cross,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 18. and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of it, should be of that excellence and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> should <hi>desire to know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 2.</p>
                  <p>Why, all this you must know is not true in <hi>strictness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> of speaking, and therefore must be taken <hi>sano sensu,</hi> and interpreted to a sound and warrantable meaning by <hi>Trope and Metaphor:</hi> and so at length, by perverting the plain, obvious, natural construction of the words of Scripture, and accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating them to their own meaning, by their <hi>forced and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> explications, these men have (as much as in them lyes) turned the Gospel of Christ into a <hi>meer fable;</hi> and for such, they have not been afraid to reproach and brand most of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriet of our Religion,</hi> and particularly those two important Articles of it, treated of in these papers, concerning <hi>Original sin,</hi> and the <hi>Redemption of the world by the death and sufferings of our Saviour;</hi> which they have had the impudence to style hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, absurd and senseless, nay, not only so, but improus and pernicious fables, such as are repugnant to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, and destructive of the salvation of mens Souls.</p>
                  <p>But to return, perhaps it will be farther said, whatever mistakes the <hi>Socinians</hi> might be guilty of about the virtue and efficacy of <hi>Christ's death:</hi> yet so far at least they are Orthodox, in that they ascribe a <hi>mighty virtue</hi> to his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which according to them, doth not consist in Christ's <hi>offering up</hi> of himself upon the Cross; but in his <hi>oblation and presentation</hi> of himself to his Father in Heaven, where <hi>now he is endued with all, power to forgive sins,</hi> and doth actually bestow that forgiveness upon Sinners.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:62459:99"/>
                  <p>Well, be it so; Christ's Sacrifice now in Heaven is very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and operative; but how doth it exert its operations? in <hi>moving or prevailing</hi> with God to forgive men? No, there was no need of that, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>inclining or perswading</hi> God to do that which he was <hi>of himself disposed,</hi> nay, had long since decreed to do: so that there is nothing that Christ suffered or performed, either on Earth or in Heaven, that properly <hi>respects God.</hi> Nay, Christ was so far from <hi>moving</hi> his Father, <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>However, tho' this sacrifice be not conversant about God, yet it shews its efficacy, by having a <hi>real proper influence</hi> upon the pardon of sin, I mean <hi>past sins.</hi> But how doth this appear? hath it an <hi>immediate influence?</hi> doth pardon of sin immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon this oblation? so one would think it did, as they sometimes <note n="2" place="bottom">

And if so, then as <hi>Grotius</hi> first stated this matter, the <hi>Expiation</hi> wrought by Christ, doth <hi>primarily</hi> and properly respect <hi>future sins,</hi> and is but <hi>mediately</hi> and secundarily conversant about <hi>past sins:</hi> for by begetting in us repentance and amendment, it <hi>first</hi> helps to withdraw us from the <hi>practice of sin,</hi> and then confers upon us the <hi>pardon of it.</hi> And thus after many <hi>windings and turnings,</hi> when these men have sufficiently <hi>tyred,</hi> and perhaps have made you <hi>giddy,</hi> with following them backward and forward, they at length bring you back to the very same place from whence you first started, and leave you just as wise and as well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as they found you.</p>
                  <p>But whatever the <hi>Socinians</hi> say, or gainsay in this matter; it will become us to believe as the Church of God hitherto hath done; that the Death of Christ was a <hi>proper and efficacious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to prevail with his Father, to pardon sinners, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was resolved to punish them: And this will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the consideration of Christs death under those two great notions, under which it is represented to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz.</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and as a <hi>Punishment.</hi> First as a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> for being a <hi>Priest</hi> he must have a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> the nature of that Office requiring it. <hi>For every High-priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining unto God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for Sins,</hi> Heb. 5. 1. Repeated again Heb. 8. 3. <hi>Wherefore it is of necessity that this man also have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to offer:</hi> and that which he offered was himself, his whole humane nature, consisting of Soul and Body. His body was given him for this purpose: for when God designed to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the Legal Sacrifices, he substituted his Son in the room of them, and fitted and prepared for him a body, that in it he might be capable of dying, and therein to resemble all other expiatory Sacrifices which were to be slain, <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith, sacrifice and offering thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62459:100"/> not, but a Body hast thou prepared me,</hi> Heb, 10. 5. Hereby, saith the Apostle, <hi>He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second,</hi> v. 9. That is, in the roome of Bulls and Goats he substituted the body of Christ, <hi>We being to be sanctified thro the offering of this body once for all,</hi> v. 10.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>his Soul</hi> is said to be <hi>made an offering for sin,</hi> Isa. 53. 10. And in short, his whole humane nature, as composed of Soul and Body was this Sacrifice, and therefore he is said <hi>to give himself for us,</hi> Eph. 5. 2. <hi>Thro the eternal Spirit he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. And <hi>he hath appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself,</hi> v. 26. He offered up a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> when <hi>he offered up himself,</hi> Heb. 7. 27. And in one word, <hi>having by himself purged our fins,</hi> That is, having finished that part of the Priestly Office, which consisted in offering sacrifice, and having thereby made an expiation for Sin, and procured pardon for it; (for this purging of sins is in Scripture ascribed to the blood of Christ which was shed on the Cross, as was shewed before) <hi>He sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on High,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. So that the purging of Sins, or the expiation of them which is the same thing, was first performed, before Christ ascended into Heaven: which single text will sufficiently confute that Impious tenet of <hi>Socin.</hi> who makes Christ to be no <hi>Priest,</hi> nor consequently to have offered any <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> till he came into Heaven, and there presented or made an oblation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his father: which was so new and strange an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being never before heard of in the world, that some of his <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:62459:101"/>
                  <p>Thus Christ by dying for us was made a Sacrifice; and if we would know what the effect and consequence of it was, this we cannot better do, then by considering the nature of those Legal Sacrifices in use among the Jews, and the end of their institution: and this we shall find was for the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin; thereby to <hi>move God</hi> to bestow pardon, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the life of the <hi>Beast,</hi> instead of that of <hi>the sinner,</hi> which was forfeited to his Justice. The <hi>Sin-offering</hi> which the Priest offered, <hi>made an atonement,</hi> that is, pacifyed the Anger, and appeased the justice of God, <hi>and then the sin was forgiven,</hi> see 5. Lev. 13. 16. 18. Numb. 15. 28. By which it appears that the <hi>life of the beast</hi> was offered in <hi>Compensation,</hi> and as such was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by God, for the <hi>life of the man.</hi> And that here was a plain <hi>surrogation</hi> of one in the roome of the other, is from hence further evident, because for some sins God would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any Sacrifice; as in the case of Murder, Adultery, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reason of which was, because having for such crimes resolved to have the life of the <hi>offender himself,</hi> he would admit of no <hi>commutation;</hi> nothing less than the death of the Malefactor himself, could, or should satisfie offended justice.</p>
                  <p>Thus tho the shedding the blood of the Sacrifice could not <hi>in all cases</hi> purchase remission, yet in <hi>no case</hi> was remission to be had without it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 21. And when it was prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there the <hi>life of the Beast</hi> went for the <hi>life of the criminal,</hi> God putting one in the <hi>room,</hi> and accepting it in the <hi>place</hi> of the other. Thus saith God, <hi>the blood is the life,</hi> or the life is in the blood, <hi>I have given it to you upon the Altar, to make an atonement for your Souls, for it is the blood that maketh an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for the Soul,</hi> Lev. 17. 11. Why is the <hi>blood</hi> so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly appointed to this purpose? why might not the Heart or Head do as well? we see God gives the reason; <hi>the life is the blood;</hi> and therefore <hi>that</hi> is the most proper to be given in exchange for the <hi>Life</hi> of the offender.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see what was the direct and proper effect of these legal Sacrifices, they made a <hi>proper and true atonement</hi> or <hi>expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for sin.</hi> They did not only <hi>declare pardon,</hi> and were so said to expiate sin, as <hi>Socin.</hi> sometimes would have it; for it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62459:101"/> is plain that forgiveness was consequent to the expiation, as in the places before mentioned, Lev. 5. <hi>The Priest shall make an atonement, and then the sin shall be forgiven. 2dly,</hi> They could not expiate sin, by withdrawing men from the practice of it: <hi>it being impossible that the blood of Bulls and Goats</hi> should in this sense <hi>take away sin;</hi> as is acknowledged by these men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains that they did it by <hi>moving God</hi> to grant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness; not indeed by their own innate virtue and efficacy, but by Gods prescription and appointment; nor yet so by his appointment, as if they were only <hi>bare conditions,</hi> without any respect in the nature of the things themselves, or tendency in them to procure pardon; no, they did it properly by way of <hi>commutation,</hi> not such an one indeed as was an <hi>equivalent</hi> to the life of the man, yet however, such as made an inferior sort of compensation, and was accepted of by God to that purpose.</p>
                  <p>Now what the Sacrifices of the old Law did but <hi>imperfectly,</hi> that the great Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, did in <hi>a more noble and eminent</hi> manner accomplish; of which all the other Sacrifices were but <hi>types and shadows.</hi> And therefore <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> they must agree, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Sin-offerings under the Law made an <hi>atonement,</hi> and thereby <hi>moved God</hi> to grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin; so must the Sacrifice of Christ, <hi>appease the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure</hi> of his Father, <hi>ex irato placatum reddere,</hi> and thereby <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> with him to pardon sinners: but it must do this in a more noble and eminent manner, as we said before, than did those other sin-offerings. For first, whereas the Sacrifices under the Law could only take off the <hi>Legal or carnal pollution; the blood of Bulls and Goats by sprinkling the unclean, could only sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh,</hi> Heb. 9. 13. But <hi>the blood of Christ</hi> could and did remove the inward guilt, <hi>and purge even the conscience,</hi> v. 14. where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when applyed to <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the sanctifying and purifying of the flesh, in the foregoing verse; which plainly denote the taking away the <hi>outward guilt or pollution;</hi> (all guilt necessarily defiling men) even so the blood of Christ washes and cleanses us from the <hi>inward and spiritual guilt of sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:62459:102"/>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>2dly,</hi> Whereas the Legal Sacrifices could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free the Criminal, from <hi>a temporal;</hi> the Sacrifice of Christ secures us from <hi>eternal punishment.</hi> Not but that the devout worshippers under the Law, <hi>accedente fide &amp; poenitentia,</hi> if they brought faith and repentance along with them, when atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made, were likewise absolved from the inward guilt, in the sight of God, and from eternal death; but this, these Sacrifices did not effect <hi>sua vi,</hi> nor <hi>per se;</hi> but only acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, <hi>in the virtue,</hi> and <hi>by the efficacy</hi> of the Sacrifice of Christ, which was represented by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> The Sacrifices under the Law, could only make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for <hi>past sins,</hi> but not <hi>for future:</hi> the reason of which was, that the life of the beast being by way of commutation given for the life of the man, (which was forfeited by some <hi>particular sin</hi> which he had committed;) it was only accepted by God in that <hi>particular case;</hi> it not being in it self, of equal value to the single life of the man, which the Law then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for that single sin; and much less could it be an equal compensation for all future violations of the Law, and the many forfeitures of the Criminals life, which must thereby be made. And therefore as men sinned, the Sacrifices were to be repeated <hi>toties quoties:</hi> by new sins, men contracted <hi>new guilt,</hi> and <hi>a new obligation</hi> to punishment, and that must be taken away by <hi>a fresh Sacrifice:</hi> but Christ by the Sacrifice of himself, hath made one perfect expiation for all sins past, and to come, and thereby hath <hi>perfected for ever them that are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed,</hi> Heb. 10. 14.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, when the <hi>Socinians</hi> say that the Jewish Sacrifices were imperfect, and that God substituted a more noble one, <hi>viz.</hi> That of his Son, in the room of them, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of many excellent ends and purposes, which these other Sacrifices could not by reason of their imbecillity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish; we acknowledge that they are so far in the right; but that which we find fault with them for, is,</p>
                  <p>First, that they limit the efficacy of Christs death, and make it thereby to have its effect in the Expiation only of <hi>some sins,</hi> and at <hi>some times.</hi> For by making the decree of sending Christ
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62459:102"/> into the world subsequent to the legal Sacrifices, and founded in the weakness and imperfection of them: they thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily confine the virtue and benefit of it, to those onely who liv'd after his coming into the world. But we say, that Christ hath <hi>obtained eternal Redemption for all mankind,</hi> who were all saved by virtue of his meritorious sufferings. <hi>By means of his death Redemption was purchased for the transgressions which were under the first Testament,</hi> 9. Heb. 15. And the Apostle doth ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably evince, that the virtue of his Sacrifice was not Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, as was that of the High Priest under the Law, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all ages past, and to come; otherwise saith he, <hi>He must have often suffered since the foundation of the world,</hi> 9. Heb. 26. which way of arguing would have been of no force, had those who lived before his coming, not wanted the benefit of his Sacrifice. But <hi>now in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin,</hi> to remove the guilt of it, by virtue of that atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he hath made <hi>by the sacrifice of himself, who was manifested</hi> indeed <hi>in these last times, but fore-ordained before the foundation of the world,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20. And what he undertook, to do so long since, was looked upon by God the Father as if it had really been done, and therefore exerted its force, and obtained its effect, before the <hi>actual oblation</hi> of himself upon the Cross. Whosoever were saved before, or under the Law, were saved by him, <hi>who was the Lamb of God that took away the sins of the world,</hi> 1. Joh. 29. <hi>And was slain from the foundation of it,</hi> 13. Rev. 8. both in the acceptance of God, and his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary undertaking; as also in all those Sacrifices, which were types and figures of him, and in whom Jesus Christ was set forth, and his death represented as it were to the eyes of the spectators.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We find fault with the <hi>Socinians</hi> that they charge the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sacrifices with a weakness, of which they were not guilty; <hi>viz.</hi> as if they made atonement onely for some <hi>lesser sins, viz.</hi> of <hi>ignorance and infirmity;</hi> but could make no expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any <hi>greater crimes of wilfulness, and against knowledge.</hi> The contrary to which will appear to any one who hath lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to peruse the sixth Chapter of <hi>Lev.</hi> except we can think,

It is true indeed, that he who <hi>sinned presumptuously,</hi> and with a high hand, who went on boldly affronting the authority of God, and shewing no tokens of repentance, <hi>was to be cut off from among his people,</hi> 15. Numb. 30. but every sin against knowledge is not to be accounted such.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it must be acknowledged indeed, that there are some sins for which God would admit of no Sacrifice, such were <hi>Murder, Adultery, Idolatry,</hi> &amp;c. as was said formerly; but the ground of this refusal was not to be taken barely from the heinousness of the crimes themselves, but from other, and those political reasons: God dealing with the <hi>Jews</hi> whose <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Soveraign</hi> he then was, as other Legislators and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors do with their subjects; who sometimes think fit to assign <hi>capital punishments</hi> to certain offences, and to accept of <hi>smaller</hi> for other crimes, <hi>in themselves</hi> not less heinous, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps adjudged not to be so prejudicial to the peace and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Civil Government, as the former. This is certain, in the first and original intention of the Law, <hi>all open violations</hi> of it, were to be punished with death; but God thought fit for divers reasons to relax the strictness and severity of his laws; and in some cases to admit of a <hi>Commutation,</hi> and in others to refuse it. Thus false swearing, tho' in it self <note n="1" place="bottom">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62459:103"/> is not assigned to those crimes, tho' not less heinous in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor less displeasing to God now than formerly.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, That which we find fault with in the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and for which we have reason to conceive <hi>a high,</hi> as well as <hi>just displeasure</hi> against them, is, that they mention the word <hi>expiation,</hi> when they speak of the Sacrifice of Christ, but they mention it frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently and insidiously, retaining the word, but denying and overthrowing the thing meant and intended by it. They, thereby meaning only our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> We, that <hi>Atonement</hi> whereby God is appeas'd, and made willing to pardon, and to be reconciled to Sinners. Nay, that <hi>very virtue</hi> which they ascribe to the Sacrifice of Christ, to <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> by begetting Faith and Repentance in us, and thereby to render us capable of pardon, and which they seem so much to magnifie, when you come narrowly to examine it, will be found to be onely a remote and an occasional virtue.</p>
                  <p>For let us consider this Sacrifice in its largest notion, as it comprehends both <hi>the death of Christ,</hi> (which as they say) was onely preparatory to his Sacrifice; and his <hi>actual oblation or presentation</hi> of himself to God the Father after his ascent into Heaven: and let it likewise include, if you please, that large power and authority with which he is now invested, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his sufferings; yet <hi>none of these,</hi> nor <hi>all of them</hi> put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, have any proper direct efficacy, to withdraw men from the practice of sin, and thereby to <hi>expiate</hi> it in this sense, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation denotes the <hi>destruction of the power of sin.</hi> They onely furnish us with good <hi>motives and external</hi> arguments, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and encourage us to repent and believe the Gospel; but all this is done without any <hi>internal operation</hi> on the minds of men; and the whole is left to their own prudence and choice, without any <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <hi>nos ad oblatam a Deo delictorum condonationem amplectendam movemur,</hi> by which we are moved to embrace the pardon of sin, as <hi>Socinus</hi> words it; but that we <hi>actually</hi> embrace it, this is owing to our <hi>own inclinations,</hi> and the voluntary determinations of our own will, without any assistance from the Grace or Spirit of Christ. From all which it must necessarily follow, that the expiation of sin, is <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> to be ascribed to a <hi>mans own will,</hi> and but <hi>secundarily</hi> and <hi>remotely;</hi> nay, but <hi>contingently,</hi> to Christ: for whatever he did or suffered, did but furnish us with good motives, (as was said before) but such, as every man is left to his own liberty to accept or refuse at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly.</hi> As the consideration of Christs death under the notion of a Sacrifice, plainly makes it appear, that he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by move God to pardon sinners, by appeasing and reconciling him to them; so it will be farther evident, if we consider it as a punishment, under which notion the Scriptures represent it to us. I cannot now insist upon all those places and passages of Scripture, by which this may be made out, and much less have I time to vindicate them from the forced interpretations and cavils of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> for this, I must refer the Reader to our Writers who have been engaged in this Controversie, and particularly to the excellent <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his Learned Book <hi>De Satisfactione:</hi> Tho' I am sorry to say it, that he hath in his Comments upon the Epistles, given up in a manner into the hands of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> all those places which he had so nobly vindicated in that Treatise.</p>
                  <p>That Christs death was a <hi>punishment,</hi> will plainly appear to any unprejudiced Reader, from those expressions in which his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are described by the Evangelical Prophet, in the 53. of his Prophesie, where he is said to be <hi>stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted,</hi> ver. 4. The following words will inform us of the cause and reason of this severe usage of God towards him; <hi>he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62459:104"/> for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of our peace was upon him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all,</hi> ver. 5, 6. If our iniquities were laid upon, or imputed to him, it is no wonder if he felt the weight and burden of them. But the <hi>Socinians</hi> will say, 'tis true, he was afflicted for our sins, that is, the end of his sufferings was to <hi>subdue the power,</hi> and to withdraw us from the <hi>practice of sin.</hi> I Ans. the following words <hi>ver.</hi> 11. evince the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> that our sins were not the <hi>final,</hi> but <hi>Impulsive and meritorious</hi> cause of those afflictions, and that chastisement; for there it is said, <hi>my righteous servant shall justifie many, because he shall bear their iniquities;</hi> now to bear their iniquity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to bear the punishment of their iniquity; so <hi>Lam. 5. 7. our fathers have sinned, and we have born their iniquities,</hi> That is, were punished for them. And this is plain from the effect and consequence of that bearing mens sins; <hi>viz.</hi> that thereby they are justified, and acquitted from the guilt of them. Now Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Absolution from sin, is the proper and natural effect, of one mans bearing the punishment of another mans Sin.</p>
                  <p>This will farther appear by other places of Scripture, where the sufferings of Christ are mentioned with relation to the <hi>justice of God,</hi> which irrefragably evince that they must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by him, <hi>as a punishment:</hi> there being a necessary and an essential relation betwixt Justice and punishment. Thus God is said to <hi>set forth Christ to be a propitiation for our sins, thro faith in his blood, that he might declare his righteousness for the remission of sins, that he might be just, and the justifyer of him that believes,</hi> 3. Rom. 25, 26. He hath now found out a way for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, whereby at the same time that he exercises mercy, he may manifest his justice; and without any prejudice to that, he may now safely and honorably justifie them who believe in his Son. Thus that text of old was interpreted by <hi>Origen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however, if it may not be thought clear and plain enough to make out this truth; we have others which cannot easily
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62459:105"/> be eluded; in which we find the sufferings of Christ menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>as a judicial act of God,</hi> shewing his displeasure against sin, and condemning it thereby. <hi>God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. That is, God sent his Son into the world, cloathed in our flesh, united to a mortal body, lyable to death, (styled therefore <hi>sinful,</hi> because <hi>sin is the wages of death</hi>) that in it he might be capable of dying for our sins: or as others would have it, he was in the likeness of sinful flesh, that is, stood in the <hi>room and place of sinners,</hi> their sins were imputed to him, and therefore he was to be made a Sacrifice for them; and hereby God <hi>condemned sin in that flesh,</hi> shewing thereby his high displeasure against it, by punishing it so severely in the person of his Son. <hi>God would not spare him,</hi> ver. 33. tho' his <hi>own Son,</hi> when he appeared in our likeness and with our sins. But at the same time that he hath given us an example of his great indignation against sin; he hath likewise for our comfort, weakned the force, and abated the power of it so far, that we need not now stand in fear of it, (I mean, if we will repent and amend our lives) for as a malefactor after he is condemned must dye, so sin is now dead; God by <hi>condemning it</hi> in the body of his Son, hath destroyed the <hi>condemning power of it, there being now no condemnation to them who are in Christ.</hi> For what he did, he did as their <hi>Surety and Sponsor,</hi> and therefore it shall be imputed to them: the same sentence that <hi>condemned</hi> sin in him, <hi>absolved</hi> them; he was <hi>punished,</hi> and they for ever freed from any <hi>obligation to punishment:</hi> I mean still, if they perform the conditions required on their parts to give them a title to this Absolution; which must always be understood when we speak of these matters.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Christ is said to have <hi>Redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, by being made a Curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. Now the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of the Law, was nothing else but the punishment which the Law threatned to the transgressors of it; and Christ freed us from that punishment, by undergoing it himself. He was <hi>Condemned, Sentence passed</hi> upon him, and he afterwards was <hi>Executed</hi> accordingly. For he was Hanged upon a Tree,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62459:105"/> which was particularly accounted an Infamous and an accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death among the Jews. And therefore those who were to be punished in the room of others, and to be made as it were <hi>Sacrificia piacularia,</hi> to make an expiation, and to avert the anger of God from a multitude or community, were to undergo that death. Thus God commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>hang up the heads of those that committed whoredom with the daughters of Moah, and joyned themselves to Baal-peor,</hi> Num. 25. 4. And this was done, not only to punish them for their own sins, but that thereby <hi>the fierce anger of the Lord might be turned from Israel.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> delivered up seven of the Sons of <hi>Saul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the <hi>Gibeonites, Who hanged them up unto the Lord in Gibeah, and thereby made an atonement for the Inheritance of the Lord,</hi> 2. Sam. 21.</p>
                  <p>And thus Christ made an atonement, by undergoing the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law, and by <hi>being made a Curse</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for us, that is, in our room and stead. He could not be punished for his own sins, being pure, and spotless, and innocent: but he was punished for us, by a proper surrogation; <hi>He gave his life a Ransome for many,</hi> Math. 20. 28. his blood went for our blood, his life for our life; he underwent the <hi>Curse,</hi> and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were freed or redeemed from it.</p>
                  <p>All which sufficiently overthrow that notion of the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> which I formerly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christs Death was only an external <hi>sign, or rite,</hi> whereby God the Father rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap> the new Covenant which he made with mankind. Now that which we have reason to dislike in this Account is, first, that they affirm that God never entred into any Covenant of Grace and Mercy with mankind, before the appearance of our blessed Savior, who first published the glad tidings of it to the world. We on the contrary declare, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of pardon and eternal life, was made and granted to the Pious under <hi>the Old Testament;</hi> which is not indeed in such Clear, Full, and Ample termes expressed there, as it is under the <hi>New;</hi> but however plainly revealed there: nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is in a manner as old as the World; having bin first given to <hi>Adam in Paradise,</hi> after his fall; confirmed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62459:106"/> to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> proclaimed by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> expected by the <hi>faithful</hi> under the Old Testament, as is evident in the Scriptures, and might easily be made appear from thence, if it were the business of this discourse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> That which we have reason to <hi>dislike,</hi> and indeed to <hi>detest</hi> in this account is, that they make the death of Christ only a bare rite of confirmation of this new Covenant, when we say, and I think have great reason to say it, (as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from what went before) that our blessed Savior by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, hath not only <hi>ratifyed,</hi> but <hi>purchased</hi> pardon of sin, and eternal life, and all other benefits contained in that Covenant: His blood was the <hi>price of our redemption,</hi> his life that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that ransome which was payd for many, and laid down in exchange for the lives of all mankind, which (as we said before,) were forfeited to Justice.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to the last thing to be made out; <hi>viz.</hi> that the death of Christ was a <hi>true and proper satisfaction</hi> made to the justice of God, for the sins of the whole world, that is, for all that ever were, or ever shall be committed to the end of it.</p>
                  <p>For first, if we consider this death as a price <hi>paid</hi> to God the Father for the redemption of mankind, then I say this was a sufficient or <hi>satisfactory payment;</hi> and this appears from that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that deliverance which is consequent hereupon; <hi>viz.</hi> from the Empire of Death, Sin, and the Devil; for over all these we have now <hi>obtained the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Who hath delivered us from the powers of darkness,</hi> Col. 1. 13. <hi>From death and him that had the power of it,</hi> that is, <hi>the Devil,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. And in short, <hi>hath delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> If we consider it <hi>as a Sacrifice,</hi> we shall find that God <hi>smelled a sweet savor in it;</hi> it was acceptable to him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by him in the behalf of the sinner. Christ offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his own life, which he gave for the life of us Criminals and <hi>his blood cryeth for better things than that of Abel;</hi> crying for pardon and obtaining it: for hereby atonement is made, pardon and forgiveness procured, God and Man reconciled.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62459:106"/>
                  <p>Lastly, Consider it as a <hi>punishment,</hi> and then we shall find it such as gave God abundant satisfaction: for as much as it was <hi>an equivalent commutation</hi> for the punishment due to all mankind, and as such it was accepted of by God. And this appears from the <hi>effect of it,</hi> which was our <hi>impunity and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi> for pardon of sin is the immediate and necessary result and consequence of his dying for us; he suffered, and we were absolved and discharged from all obligation to sufferings. And indeed if these sufferings had not bin of an equal value for the sufferings of all mankind, they would not have answered one of the main ends and reasons of inflicting them; which was to make <hi>a compensation</hi> to the justice of God, for the wrongs and injuries done to his authority by the violation of his Laws; in which consists the formal notion of punishment, as it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; which is to be distinguished from that sort of punishment, which we call <hi>castigation,</hi> as <note n="1" place="bottom">Arist. Rhetor. Lib. 1. Cap. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath well observed, forasmuch as chastisement is for the sake and for the good of him <hi>that suffers;</hi> but <hi>vindicta,</hi> vengeance, which is the most proper sort of punishment, is for the sake of him that <hi>inflicts the sufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may understand this aright; we must know that this latter sort of punishment, which we call <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>vindicta noxae;</hi> when inflicted by God, may have a double aspect; one, as it <hi>looks forward,</hi> and as such it is both designed, and is likewise in it self, a very proper method to deter men from the practice of sin, who may read their own doom in the punishment of others: and thus it proves a good fence and security to the authority of God, by preventing the contempt and violation of it for the future. And when this is the chief and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intendment of it, then it is properly called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>punitio propter exemplum;</hi> punishment for example sake; upon which account, the word <hi>Example,</hi> both in our own and the learned Languages is taken for punishment: to make a man
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62459:107"/> an Example being the same thing as to punish him for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and to deter others.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> It <hi>looks backward likewise,</hi> and then it is inflicted by way of <hi>compensation</hi> for the wrongs done to his Authority; the injury which he sustained by the disobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, being in some measure recompensed by the punishment. It hath bin reasonably doubted, whether men in inflicting punishment, may aim at any such personal reparation, abstracted from the publick good; but there can be no doubt made of this, with relation to God, by any that believe the eternity of Hell torments (as I have elsewhere shewed <hi>part.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 33.) which can have no other end but the <hi>satisfaction of divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi> They are not inflicted for the good of the partys pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and so are not to be reputed▪ <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now let us consider the sufferings of Christ (which we have allready proved to be a punishment) under either of those two former notions, of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the attribute that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands punishment) will still be demanding it, and never cease to do so, till it be fully satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we here fly to the pleasure of God, and say, any thing is satisfactory which he will accept of as such: for here we are to consider the reason and end of the infliction. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we consider things only in themselves, perhaps God might have found out a way for the salvation of Sinners, without demanding perfect satisfaction; or, as some may think, without any punishment at all: but when we consider, that now he hath declared his pleasure, that he will not pardon sin, nor shew <hi>his mercy</hi> to the sinner, except in such a way as may <hi>satisfie his justice;</hi> in this case we must consider now, not only the <hi>pleasure of God</hi> considered abstractedly in it self; but his pleasure with relation <hi>to his justice;</hi> and then the nature of the punishment at the same time comes under consideration, which must be such as may satisfie the demands of that justice; which it cannot do except it be proportioned to the offence, and of an equal value to the punishment remitted. And such was the punishment of Christ, a thing of <hi>Infinite value,</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to it from the <hi>dignity of his person;</hi> who was the Son of God, <hi>equal to his Father,</hi> and therefore was able to make him a sufficient compensation, and did so by dying for us.</p>
                  <p>And this the Apostle admirably and irrefragably makes out in several places of his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of the perfection and dignity of the Sacrifice of Christ, and its preeminence above all the Sacrifices of the Law; and <hi>particularly</hi> in this, <hi>that whereas the blood of bulls and goats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>could sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh, the blood of Christ could purge the Conscience from dead works,</hi> Heb. 9▪ 13, 14.</p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:62459:108"/>
                  <p>Here, first I suppose it will be granted, that the <hi>purging of the Conscience</hi> in this place, denotes the removal of the guilt of sin. This is own'd by the <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves, and therefore need not be proved. <hi>2dly.</hi> That guilt is nothing but an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to punishment. <hi>3dly.</hi> That the death of Christ was properly <hi>a punishment.</hi> I know this is denyed both by the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> and the followers of <hi>Episcopius,</hi> but is owned by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians; and therefore I shall here take it for granted, having in some measure proved it to be so before. Now if the death of Christ be a punishment, then his blood must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the guilt of sin, by satisfying Justice which is that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute in God that demands punishment, there being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and essential relation between them. <hi>4thly.</hi> That the blood of Christ purges the Conscience, <hi>sua vi &amp; efficacia,</hi> by its own proper <hi>virtue and efficacy;</hi> which efficacy can consist in nothing but this, that the death of Christ was of equal value to that punishment which the Law threatned, and Justice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demanded. For when a man hath fully undergone all that the Law requires; then all obligation to further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, naturally and necessarily ceaseth. Now from all this it must unavoidably follow, that the death of Christ was a <hi>just and equal Compensation</hi> made to the Justice of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>true and proper Satisfaction</hi> for the sins of the whole world. Neither ought we here to have recourse to the divine <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>estimation;</hi> as if the sufferings of Christ were therefore only <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> because God the Father was pleased to esteem them such: for tho' in this case the <hi>Consent</hi> of God was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, to render the punishment of Christ available for the impunity of others; for God might have demanded the life of the Criminal, and have refused any Compensation, tho' often times a greater value than it, if he had so pleased: but supposing this consent, then I say, that the virtue and efficacy of Christs death, is not to be taken only from the approbation and appointment of God, but from the intrinsick value of that death it self; otherwise the Apostles arguing would be of no
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62459:108"/> force. <hi>The Sacrifices under the Law could not take away sins,</hi> Heb. 10. 11. <hi>The blood of bulls and goats could only sanctifie to the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the flesh;</hi> that is, the blood of those Sacrifices could only wash off the legal uncleanness, and remove the political and temporal guilt; but still the Criminal might stand guilty before God, and be obnoxious to his vengeance. <hi>But the blood of Christ can purge even the Conscience,</hi> Heb. 9. 13, 14. that is, can absolutely extinguish the whole obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both Temporal and Eternal, and set the man right in the esteem of God, and restore him entirely to his favour, Now if in interpreting these words we must have recourse only to <hi>the pleasure of God;</hi> then it amounts to no more than this: That under the Law God did not think fit to appoint the blood of <hi>bulls and goats,</hi> to make expiation for the inward guilt of sin; but now he hath been pleas'd to accept of the blood of Christ to that purpose; tho' it be not of equal value nor bears a just proportion to the offences which are remitted by it. How doth this shew us the <hi>superlative virtue and excellence</hi> of the blood of Christ, above that of the legal Sacrifices. All the difference at this rate, is in the divine acceptation, not in the things themselves.</p>
                  <p>Nay, saith the Apostle, <hi>it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin.</hi> How not possible?

But what they could not do, the blood of Christ hath done sufficiently and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62459:109"/> effectually; it hath <hi>throughly purged the Conscience</hi> both from guilt and terror; having removed all the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all the fears and expectation of it: for <hi>by one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,</hi> Heb. 10. 14. He hath laid down his life, <hi>the life of him that was God,</hi> which was worth the whole world, and consequently his death was an equal exchange for the punishment due to all mankind: wherefore it need not be repeated, as were the legal Sacrifices by reason of their imperfection; for now once for all he hath entirely <hi>put away sin by the Sacrifice of himself,</hi> Heb. 9. 26. and all his devout worshippers, <hi>being once throughly purged, have no more conscience of Sin,</hi> and consequently have no need of a new Atonement and Expiation to be made.</p>
                  <p>Add to all this, that the Church of God in all Ages, hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the sufferings of Christ to be truely and properly <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi> of pardon, and therefore the devout members of it have always recommended themselves to the favor of God, <hi>thro the Mediation</hi> and <hi>by the merits</hi> of his Son. For tho pardon of sin, with respect to us sinners, be an act of <hi>pure Grace and mercy,</hi> of undeserved kindness and compassion in God; yet with res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Christ it hath the notion of <hi>a debt,</hi> which he hath a right and title to in point of strict Justice; and therefore claims it as the purchase of his blood; which was a price of equal value to all the benefits of the new Covenant, which were thereby obtained. And therefore now in his <hi>glorious Intercession</hi> at the right hand of his Father, we must not imagine or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him to our selves in the posture of an <hi>humble Supplicant,</hi> entreating and begging mercy and pardon for his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as matter of Grace and Favour; but claiming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it; and saying, <hi>Father, I will</hi> that they who repent and believe in me, (for he who hath purchased the blessings of the new Covenant for us, having the free disposal of them, may with the consent of his Father, bestow them upon whom, and upon what conditions he thinks fit) should be absolved and pardoned; <hi>I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> and partake of it; <hi>for thou hast loved me;</hi> and I would have thee <hi>to love them as thou hast loved me,</hi> Joh. 17. 23. 24.</p>

                  <p>This is the Catholick Faith and Doctrine, concerning this <hi>great and fundamental Article</hi> of the Christian Religion, which is plainly revealed in the holy Scriptures, embraced by the Church of God in all ages since the first planting of one: and the substance of what they have believed and delivered down to us, is briefly and comprehensively summed up by our Church in the Prayer of Consecration, in the Office for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>That Christ by suffering death upon the Cross for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made there a full, perfect, and sufficient Sacrifice, oblation and satisfaction, for the sins of the whole world,</hi> Or as we have it in our thirty first Article, <hi>The offering of Christ once made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual.</hi>

                  <p>If we appeal to the suffrage and voice of mankind speaking in the Laws enacted by them, then we shall find that it is not repugnant to Justice to punish <hi>a Sponsor or Proxie</hi> for the crimes, and in the room of the <hi>offending party;</hi> this having been the practice in some cases, and for some weighty reasons, of the most civiliz'd Nations of the world; especially where there was the consent of the suffering person.

                  <p>But to proceed, this Opinion which hath prevailed among Christians concerning the Redemption of the world by Christ, is not only an <hi>absurd,</hi> but likewise (as the <hi>Socin.</hi> tell us) a <hi>very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious error:</hi> it is not an idle fancy which may do no great harm, but a very dangerous mistake; such as is first, <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>For first of all, supposing Christ to be such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary person as we imagin, yet the dignity of his nature will add no worth to his sufferings; <note n="1" place="bottom">Id. ibid.</note>
                     <hi>for with God there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons.</hi> But <hi>2dly,</hi> suppose there were, yet there was nothing <hi>singular or extraordinary</hi> either in the person or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, which should induce us to imagine, that any satisfaction either was, or could thereby be given to God for the sins of men. And therefore in short, as there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of idioms or propertys from one nature to another; so there is as little communication of value and dignity from the nature to the punishment. Therefore tho Christ <hi>was stricken, smitten of God and afflicted;</hi> yet this really signifies no more <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quocirca, si plaga, puta hominis corpori inflicta, nullam per se vim majorem habere potest, quam si eadem bestiae alicui inflicta fuisset; multo magis quicquid passus est Christus nullam majorem vim per se habere potest, quam si quilibet purus homo idem passus esset,</hi> Ibid.</note> than if the same were done to any ordinary man; nay these stroaks are of no more virtue, then if they were laid upon the body of a Beast, or upon the back of an Asse, or a Mule which have no understanding. Thus do these wretched men, in the heat of their opposition to our blessed Savior, rise up to the highest pitch of wickedness and fury; like the Jews of old, being full of all envy and mischief, they speak against the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the spirit of God, <hi>contradicting and blaspheming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I must again address my self to the Christian Reader, and beseech him by the mercies of God, and the bowels of Christ; nay, I must conjure him by the remembrance of his Agonies and sweat in the Garden, of his bitter death and passion, that he would not suffer <hi>the blood</hi> of his Saviour (that <hi>precious blood</hi> that was their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62459:112"/> shed for his sake) to be thus slighted and undervalued, and <hi>esteemed but as a common or a prophane thing.</hi> For what will be the issue and consequence of this, but, when these men have brought <hi>down</hi> the price of <hi>it so low,</hi> that others should <hi>trample it under their feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed, as our Doctrine concerning Salvation by Christ is <hi>prejudicial to the Souls of men,</hi> so it is, if we believe the <hi>Socinians, highly injurious to the honor of God;</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Quid vel absurdius, vel iniquius, ob eamque rem, cum de Deo loquimur, magis impium ac detestandum excogitari potuit? Is qui omnis aequitatis ac rectitudinis fons est, tam iniquum &amp; pravum facinus contra suum ipsius decretum admiserit? Cujus si rationem diligentissime inquiras, nullam profecto reperies, ut hic non summae iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis tantum &amp; pravitatis, suprema cum impietate, Deus accusetur; sed extremae quoque inscitiae ac fatuitatis, per turpissimam atque indignissimam blasphemiam &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliam insimuletur.</hi> Id. cap. 3. ejusd. lib. <hi>Quid enim causae fuit, ut in istum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem filium suum innocentissimum Deus tam dira &amp; execrabili morte affici voluerit. cum satisfactione ista nil opus esset; ita &amp; liberalitas perit, &amp; pro beneficentissimo &amp; munificentissimo Deo, immanem &amp; sordidum, suprema cum impietate nefandoque sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegio, nobis confingimus.</hi> Id. cap. 2.</note> for hereby we rob God of the honor of his Justice, equity, liberality, and beneficence, which the Scriptures every where do so highly magnifie: nay, instead of a <hi>benigne and munificent Deity,</hi> we form to our selves the notion of a <hi>mean, cruel, sordid, illiberal Being,</hi> and thus to represent God is the highest Impiety and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Add to all this, that since God could pardon the sins of men out of meer Grace and Bounty, now to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire strict payment and satisfaction to his Justice before he would do so; <hi>is, say they,</hi> an argument of barbarous and savage cruelty, rather than of kindness and liberality.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to conclude this point, and to summ up all that they have said against this great Article of our Religion; in few words it amounts to this, that the Doctrine concerning the satisfaction of Christ, and the Salvation of the World by that means; is <hi>a false, erroneous, foolish, absurd, whymsical, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, impious, monstrous, blasphemous</hi> Opinion <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Satanas per anile Commentum de praeaeterno Dei filio obscuravit doctrinam de Christo: &amp; salutarem de ipsius munere doctrinam, per obsurdum, perniciosum, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemum dogma de Christi satisfactione foede conspurcavit.</hi> Smal. Refut. Nov. Monstr. Nov. Arr. cap. 27.</note> Would not any man think, that these wretches were censuring some position taken out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which hath thus fallen under
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62459:113"/> so great and heavy a Condemnation. No, it is no less than one of the most important and capital Articles of our Religion, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all good Christians, not only as the <hi>object of their Faith,</hi> but likewise as the <hi>foundation of their Hopes,</hi> which are entirely subverted when this Doctrine is once overthrown. And yet I will be bold to say, that there is not one, no not the <hi>worst pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi> in all that impious bundle of lyes, errors and absurdities before mentioned, that equals, (at least doth not exceed) <hi>the best part of our Gospel,</hi> in point of <hi>folly, falshood and impiety,</hi> if what these men affirm of it be true. The Church of God hath now for many ages laboured under some strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable infatuation, in mistaking such a gross, senseless, Opinion, for one of the main and principal parts of their Faith. But it is high time to rectifie this mistake; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Religion we may think fit to make choice of, we cannot (at this rate) choose a worse than the Christian, if this doctrine makes up (as most think it doth) a main part of it.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I cannot much wonder at the story that is told, of a certain <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> who applyed themselves to <hi>Ben Hamet,</hi> late Embassador here from the Emperor of <hi>Fez▪</hi> and proposed in behalf of themselves and their brethren, that a good correspondence might be settled, and a close League enter'd into, between the <hi>English▪</hi> Unitarians, and the Orthodox Churches of <hi>Algiers</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi> And if such passages as these shall be published, and permitted to pass uncontrolled among us; the minds of many may in good time be disposed, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the <hi>Bible</hi> for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as they say, some <note place="bottom">Paulus Alciatus, Adamus Nauserus, &amp;c.</note> of the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Unitarians in the last Age did.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, we may hence be convinced, what great reason we all have to <hi>contend for our holy Faith,</hi> and to vindicate it from the calumnies and slanders cast upon it by these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, who thus openly, with unparallel'd insolence and malice, reproach and vilifie our doctrine; and who (as it is to be feared) would shew no great tenderness to our persons, if they had us in their clutches; <hi>God keep us out of them.</hi> And this, as it is a duty incumbent upon all Christians, according to their circumstances and abilities; so is it in a more particular
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62459:113"/> manner upon us, who are dedicated more immediately to the service of Religion; and who most not only give an account of our own actions, but are likewise accountable for the Souls of others committed to our charge. It is true indeed, that they who are engaged in this service, must look for many (and those not small) discouragements: they must expect, that their labours in this kind shall be <hi>undervalued,</hi> their writings (if they have leisure and inclinations to commit any thing to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) <hi>censured,</hi> nay, their intentions <hi>misconstrued;</hi> and it is well if they escape so, and have not likewise their <hi>persons defam'd</hi> into the bargain.</p>
                  <p>But none of all these, should prove a discouragement to any good-man, and hinder him from doing his duty. And indeed he deserves not <hi>the name,</hi> and much less <hi>the blessedness</hi> of a true Christian, who cannot be content to suffer more than all this comes to, for the sake, and in the defence of his blessed Lord and Master, who hath done and suffered so much for him. Nay, not only the consideration of our duty, but that of our truest interest, should make us willing to be engaged in this holy warfare: for in the conclusion, it will appear to be much better, that we be found (if the will of God be so) among such who <hi>suffer for the truth,</hi> than in the number of them who <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute,</hi> or those who <hi>betray it.</hi> Tho' indeed, a notable pretence hath been found out, wherewithal to palliate and varnish over this treachery; and that is, the pretence <hi>of moderation and tenderness</hi> towards these dissenters from us, I mean in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nay, in the fundamental doctrines of our holy Religion, if there be any such.</p>
                  <p>By this we may see, that the Devil is become wiser now in this last Age, than he was formerly. And it is no wonder, that the older he is, the craftier he should likewise grow. In former times he set himself with all his might to overthrow the Christian Religion, by <hi>methods of his own contriving;</hi> by inhuman and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy persecutions, by Racks and Gibbets, Grid-Irons and Fiery Fornaces, Crusadoes and Inquisitions. But all these proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: for tho hereby he destroyed the <hi>persons</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> yet their <hi>Faith</hi> survived the malice of their Enemies, and like the <hi>Phoenix</hi> rose more gloriously out of the ashes of the <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

                  <p>And hereby, tho I shall not exactly observe the method, I may yet, I hope, in some measure <hi>answer,</hi> and perhaps more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually <hi>compass</hi> the design, which I chiefly proposed to my self when I first undertook this work; which was to fortify the minds of men, and guard them from the infection of those errors, which have so hastily, and I am sorry to say, so largely diffused themselves among divers persons of different ranks and orders, to the great trouble and amazement of all such, who have not shaken off all fear of God, and regard for his holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as yet preserved and established among us.</p>
                  <p>There are none who are any ways conversant in these matters, but very well know, that many of the Socinians, especially heretofore, were such who put on the outward shape and sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a more than ordinary piety, and in their writings have advanced the precepts of Morality to a very great height, in which they have bin very copious and pathetical, in declaiming against vice, recommending virtue, and with great vehemence pressing the necessity of a good life; which we must all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is one of <hi>the principal,</hi> and as they tell us <hi>the only end</hi> of all Religion. How far they have bin in good earnest in all this, is not so easy nor so safe for any of us to determin; it will therefore become us to leave them to the judgment of Allmighty God, by whose most righteous sentence, they and we must in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion either stand or fall. Only thus much I cannot forbear to say upon this occasion, that by advancing Morality upon the ruins of the Christian Religion, and at the same time that they enforce obedience to the Laws of Christ, by <hi>undermining those motives</hi> which are, tho not the <hi>only,</hi> yet the <hi>chief and principal causes</hi> which produce and support it, they take effectual care to render all their exhortations, as far as in them lyes, useless and insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, and thereby give too great occasion to <hi>suspect their since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in this whole affair.</p>
                  <p>But let their intentions be what they will, it is certain that by these means, they have very notably gain'd these two, and those no inconsiderable advantages: <hi>Ist,</hi> hereby they have prevailed with many, who otherwise seem to be of a different opinion from them, to entertain very <hi>favorable thoughts,</hi> nay a <hi>very high esteem</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62459:118"/> their persons and writings, for the sake of their Piety: and this esteem, by degrees helps to <hi>extenuate their errors,</hi> and covers the malignity of them, which in time come to be accounted but small and very pardonable mistakes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2ly,</hi> Which is a necessary consequence of the former, they hereby, (I mean among them who entertain those favorable thoughts of them) take off the keenness and edge of those resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are absolutely needful to engage men in a warm and vigorous opposition of their pernicious tenets: for while you <hi>extenuate an error,</hi> at the same time and for the same reason, you <hi>weaken the opposite truth;</hi> and by the same degrees that your <hi>zeal</hi> against the one abates, your <hi>concern</hi> for the other must grow cool, and in time perhaps be extinguished. It is therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and beyond all doubt, that it cannot be worth any mans time of pains, to be engaged in the vindication of a truth, where the opposite error is so harmless and inoffensive, that it scarce deserves our <hi>notice</hi> and much less a <hi>confutation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this seems to be the apprehension which many now adays have of the <hi>bold and dangerous</hi> opinions of <hi>Socin.</hi> as they formerly were accounted. For some there are who pretending to more than ordinary degrees of moderation, I mean in the affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which a greater scope and latitude is thought fit and reasonable to be allowed, (for in their own private concerns they do not think themselves under the same strict obligation to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it) who tell us, that there is indeed some difference between us and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but it is only about some points of high speculation, which are placed out of the reach of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and what is not the object of <hi>our knowledg,</hi> need not be the subject of <hi>our care,</hi> neither is it fit that any man should be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> for what he cannot fully and plainly <hi>comprehend.</hi> It is true our adversaries despise the <hi>mysteries of the Gospel,</hi> but at the same time they retain a due regard for <hi>the precepts of it,</hi> and and are at perfect agreement with us, in promoting the true end of all Religion which is holyness and a good life. All other matters in dispute between us are but Metaphysical notions, and niceties of the Schooles, about which men may argue <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and wrangle eternally; but never make either themselves or
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62459:119"/> others in the least either wiser or better; but rather on the other hand, they hereby do a great deal of mischief; by engaging men in <hi>warm and senseless disputes</hi> about trifling and inconsiderable matters; dividing their judgments, and alienating their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from each other, and by that means, disturb the peace and quiet of the world, which is of greater consequence, and ought therefore to be more valued by us, than these curious but useless speculations.</p>
                  <p>Others there are who, tho they cannot think so mildly and gently of <hi>these errors,</hi> yet retain a great respect for the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of them, and therefore to hide their nakedness, in great compassion, and out of Christian charity to be sure, they fling a mantle of <hi>justice and probity</hi> over them: by which means they do at the same time <hi>adorn their persons,</hi> and conceal the <hi>deformity</hi> of their opinions, which in their own proper and native dress, would be apt to create a just horror and detestation in the minds of all sincere and serious Christians.</p>
                  <p>Now to take of the mask and disguise under which these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious opinions walk, not only <hi>with impunity,</hi> but with <hi>confidence,</hi> and some sort of <hi>reputation and credit</hi> among us, is the design of this present undertaking, and to represent them in their own true colours, stripped of all that paint and varnish wherewith they usually are disguised; and to place them in a true light, in which they may be viewed in their just deformity and danger, and with that numerous train of evil consequences which inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably attend them: whereby it will appear, that under what soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening terms soever some persons may think fit to represent them, yet that truely and really they are highly dishonorable to God, destructive to the souls of men, and tend plainly to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of <hi>all,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> the ruin of which, I mean if these principles and opinions should univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally prevail, they will more effectually accomplish, than any, or than all the other methods that ever yet have bin made use of to destroy it.</p>
                  <p>This is really a <hi>heavy charge,</hi> and therefore by some may be thought an <hi>uncharitable one;</hi> wherefore I must now proceed to make it good; and in order thereunto I shall first begin with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62459:119"/>
                     <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> which is comprehended in the writings of the Old and New Testament, which contain a discovery of all those things which we are obliged either to believe or practise in order to obtain Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Now the truth and credit of these holy writings are more ways then one assaulted by these men; some whereof are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and at a greater distance, whereby they do not so much <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppose,</hi> as <hi>insidiously attack</hi> the holy Scriptures, and thereby <hi>secretly undermine</hi> that Authority, which they pretend <hi>openly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg.</hi> Others are more plainly and directly levelled against their authority and inspiration.</p>
                  <p>Among those more oblique and remote methods, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal which are made use of by them, and which I shall more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insist upon are these two; The first is that whereby they speak slightly and contemptibly of Faith, in comparison of Morality, to which they do not only give the preference, but place in a kind of opposition to it: The second way is by advancing <hi>Reason above Revelation,</hi> and making it the <hi>supreme judge</hi> of all those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which are made by this latter, and its dictates the <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Rule</hi> both of our Faith and Practice.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the first, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereby they speak contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibly of <hi>Faith,</hi> and consequently, must at the same time endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to bring into contempt that part of the revelation which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Articles of Faith;</hi> for if faith be unnecessary, it can be for no other reason but because the <hi>objects</hi> about which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant are so; and if those <hi>objects</hi> are trifling and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the <hi>discovery and revelation</hi> of them must be equally useless and insignificant; so that there being a necessary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these three, their Credit and Reputation must stand or fall together: He that is not a friend to each, is a friend to none of them and he that opposes one, is an enemy to them all.</p>
                  <p>Now that I may proceed clearly and orderly in this matter; according to the method made use of in the two former Treatises, I shall shew, first what <hi>the Scriptures</hi> inform us concerning Faith and the Articles and mysteries of our Faith; and then what <hi>the Socinians</hi> and their friends say of these matters; which upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination will be found to be directly repugnant to what the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62459:120"/> holy writings affirm, tending plainly to disparage the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and thereby to bring into contempt the <hi>Religion</hi> which is discovered by it.</p>
                  <p>If we look into the Scriptures, and especially those of the New Testament, we shall find that they pretend to give us an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of some things concerning <hi>God</hi> both as to his <hi>Nature, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and Decrees,</hi> which no human understanding ever conceived, none the most piercing judgment that ever mortal man was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of could ever penetrate; and therefore they are styled by our Savior the <hi>Mysterys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which were <hi>hid from the wise and prudent,</hi> but by the distinguishing mercy of God <hi>revealed unto babes, Matt.</hi> 11. 25. Such was that great truth that Christ <hi>was the son of the living God,</hi> which was a truth of so great importance, that our Savior tells <hi>Peter</hi> who made that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of him, that he would <hi>build his Church upon it, as on a rock against which the Gates of Hell should not prevail;</hi> and withall that it was of that sublime and mysterious nature, <hi>that flesh and blood could not reveal it unto him, but his Father which was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Math.</hi> 16. 17. Again, as <hi>no man could know the son,</hi> who he really was, as to his <hi>nature, descent, and original,</hi> which was all Heavenly and Divine, but by the revelation of the Father; so could no man <hi>know the Father but the Son, and he to whom the son would reveal him, Math.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what concerns the <hi>unity and essential perfections of the Godhead,</hi> which as the Socinians and Remonstrants tell us was all that was necessary to be known of him, this was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered long before: so likewise what relates to matters of meer morality and the practice of virtue, was in great measure made known before Christ's coming; and in that sense God might be said to be seen by the light of nature: but there were some other things, concerning <hi>his person and subsistence,</hi> as he stands in relation to the two other glorious persons in the Trinity, the Son and Holy Ghost, which no humane reason could possibly discover; as also concerning his <hi>Counsel and Will,</hi> in reference to those great transactions which concern the Salvation of mankind, which no <hi>wit of man</hi> could ever find out, as lying hid in the <hi>secret and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counsel of his mind,</hi> which therefore no finite wisdom or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62459:120"/> understanding could ever fathom or draw out, only he <hi>who lay in the bosome of the Father,</hi> either did, or could discover.</p>
                  <p>To the same purpose St. <hi>Paul</hi> assures us that there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>deep things of God,</hi> which were the results of his meer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which none could know or be conscious to, <hi>but the Spirit of God, who searcheth all things,</hi> and which things God <hi>hath revealed to mankind by his Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11. or otherwise they must for ever have bin ignorant of them. Hence the doctrine of the Gospel which contains the discovery of these secrets, is styled the <hi>mystery of the Gospel,</hi> Eph. 6. 19. <hi>The mystery of Christ</hi> Col. 4. 3. <hi>The mystery of Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 9. And the great <hi>mystery of Godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> verse 16. of that Chap. Nay the same Apostle, when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions these things thus revealed, speaks of them in very lofty and magnificent terms, that they were <hi>such as eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, i. e.</hi> the heart of man could not conceive and find them out, 1 Cor. 2. 9. And therefore we find him very copious in the magnifying his office and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, upon this very score, that he published the <hi>wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom of God, ordained before the world unto our Glory,</hi> v. 7. That he and the other Apostles were <hi>Stewards of the mysteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1.</p>
                  <p>From all which these two things seem to be very plain, and as one might reasonably think beyond all dispute. First, as was said before, that the Gospel contains a revelation of certain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which no wit or invention of man could ever discover, no reason can comprehend: why else should they be styled <hi>mysteries,</hi> such <hi>as were hid from the wise and prudent,</hi> and known only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation? How could it otherwise with truth or decency be said, <hi>that flesh and blood could not discover them?</hi> and that the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and his merciful intentions for the Redemption of mankind, which were discovered in the Gospel, did <hi>surpass all knowledg?</hi> Eph. 3. 19. Lastly, it could not otherwise be agreeable to truth, what yet is roundly and without any hesitation delivered by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>That the natural man,</hi> who is guided only by the light of nature, or human reason, <hi>doth not perceive the things of the Spirit of God,</hi> those spiritual and sublime mysteries which are revealed by the spirit of God: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>non capit, percipit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62459:121"/> intelligit,</hi> so this word is rendered by several Interpreters; the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being the same with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is used in the same verse; he neither doth understand, nor indeed <hi>can he know them:</hi> or let it be rendered as we do in our translation, <hi>non accipit, recipit,</hi> he doth not <hi>receive them, non ita admittit ut approbet,</hi> he doth not admit them so as to approve of them, it will amount to the same purpose. And indeed both these things seem to be very evident from the words: <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>things of God,</hi> which are discovered by the spirit of God in the Gospel, are such, as transcend the power of the most exalted reason to find out and comprehend; nay not only so, some of them do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>surpass,</hi> but seem <hi>opposite</hi> to the understandings of men guided only by the light of nature; <hi>they are foolishness unto him,: i. e.</hi> absurd and repugnant to reason. So that in short, this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this natural man, <hi>qui non alia quam naturali animi luce praeditus est, qui humana ratione omnia metitur,</hi> who measures all things by the standard of human reason, cannot discover these sublime truths by his own natural abilities; and after they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he is so far from admitting and embracing them, that he rather rejects them as absurd and foolish, and quite contrary to those rules <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of human wisdom, of bare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whereby he judges of the truth or falshood of things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> That which follows farther from hence, is that these truths thus Revealed, are matters of <hi>great importance</hi> and high consequence; otherwise the Gospel were not to be so highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, nor ought the Ministers of it so mightily to magnify themselves and their Ministry upon this account. Sure the Son of God would never have come <hi>out of the bosom of the Father,</hi> and discovered what lay hid there; nor the spirit of God have <hi>searched for these deep things,</hi> except they had bin matters of great weight and moment, and the revelation of them of great and high importance to the world. And therefore we find the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures laying a great stress upon these matters, representing them under such Characters, and with such high Elogies, that it is plain, they expected we should entertain these sublime truths, with great reverence, attention, and esteem, that they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all thankfulness, and <hi>accounted by us worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation:</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62459:121"/> or in one word which will comprehend all this, that we should <hi>believe</hi> them. Which leads me to consider what these holy writings say of the <hi>Act of Faith,</hi> as well as what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard, they have said of the <hi>Object and Articles of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here we shall find that they lay a great stress upon the <hi>Grace of Faith,</hi> and especially as it hath Christ for its object, which is the great duty of the Gospel; recommended to us so often and so earnestly by our blessed Savior, that one would think, there should be no room left for doubt in this affair, by any who own the name of Christ, and are therefore willing to govern their judgment, and regulate their apprehensions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>usefulness or necessity</hi> of things, by the sentence of their Savior. Now he hath assured us more than once, that our <hi>happiness or ruine</hi> depends upon our having or wanting this Grace. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath everlasting life, and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Jo. 3. 36. In imitation of the <hi>Serpent which Moses lift up in the wilderness,</hi> our Savior tells us that <hi>he was to be lifted up</hi> upon the Cross, that whosoever looks up to him by the eye of Faith, <hi>whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life,</hi> verse 15. God sent his son into the world for the salvation of it, but that the end of his coming may be accomplished in us, this Grace is absolutely requisite, that thereby we may be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled to those benefits which he has purchased for us by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life,</hi> v. 16. and again in the 18. verse, <hi>He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Thus our Savior delivered himself when he preached to men in his own person while he was in the world; and when he was to leave it, the like commission he gave to his Apostles, and required them to publish the same doctrine: <hi>Go into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every Creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned,</hi> Mark 16. 15, 16. They were to proclaim the glad tidings of Salvation to all mankind, and were withal to inform them of the great condition required on their parts to make them capable of it, which was Faith. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62459:122"/> in pursuance of this Commission, we find Them still inculcating the necessity of this Grace, as antecedently requisite to give men a right and title to pardon of sin, and all the other blessings of the new Covenant. This was that which <hi>Philip</hi> required of the Eunuch, Acts 8. 37. <hi>To believe with all his heart,</hi> what he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards tells him he did, viz. <hi>that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</hi> To that important question of the Jaylour, <hi>Sirs what must I do to be saved?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> returns this answer, <hi>believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, and thy house,</hi> Acts 16. 31. And in short, that we are acquitted from guilt, reconciled to God, justifyed, pardoned, saved, they tell us is owing to faith in the son of God.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have only spoken of faith in Christ, as it hath him for its object; but forasmuch as this faith respects the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, natures, offices, actions,</hi> and <hi>sufferings</hi> of our blessed Savior, it doth by consequence infer the necessity of believing the other Articles of our Holy Religion, which are either directly included in, or have some necessary relation to, this great and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doctrine. And thus we see what the Scriptures inform us of the doctrines of our faith, and of the faith of those doctrines; both which are put together by St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter of his Gospel verse 31. <hi>These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the son of God, and that believing ye might have life thro his name.</hi> Which words give us an account of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reason that moved our Evangelist and Apostle to write and publish his Gospel, which was to assert and vindicate this great truth, then and since vehemently opposed, that <hi>Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. 2dly,</hi> They farther inform us of the importance of that discovery; that hereby is revealed to us, not only a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, but likewise a necessary and fundamental truth, upon the knowledge and belief of which depends our happiness and <hi>eternal life.</hi> In short, from hence it appears, that both the doctrine here recommended to our faith is of high consequence, a necessary and essential part of the Christian Religion, <hi>that Jesus is the son of God:</hi> and also that the belief of this doctrine is of equal importance, of necessary and indispensable obligation, our happiness absolutely depending upon it, <hi>That believing ye might have life thro his name.</hi>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:62459:122"/>
                  <p>It is time now we should enquire what the Socinians affirm of both these matters. And first what they say of the <hi>doctrines or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of our faith. And here in general, they tell us that there are no doctrines delivered in the Scriptures, and proposed to our belief, which surpass <note n="1" place="bottom">

Let us consider them under each of these cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
                  <p>First, they say they are <hi>false,</hi> as being opposite to the plain dictates of reason, whereby we ought to judge of the truth or falshood of things. And such are the doctrines of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Incarnation, and satisfaction</hi> of our blessed Savior; which are, say they, not only <hi>above</hi> the conceptions of men, but directly <hi>contrary</hi> to them; and indeed are not only repugnant to reason, <note n="2" place="bottom">Socin. libell.

But I have done it for the sake of such who wanting time and leisure to peruse their writings, may here at one view inform themselves of those <hi>calumnies</hi> which ly dispersed and scattered in their writings, which with great assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are almost every day published by them. And there are two reasons which have principally induced me to it, which I think are of some consideration in this affair.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that I may undeceive the Reader, and rectify those mistakes which otherwise he may, or perhaps hath bin lead into, by that unwary and indeed unjust account which hath bin given of our Adversaries and their polemical performances; which sometimes have bin recommended to the world, under the highest characters of <hi>prudence, temper, modesty, gravity,</hi> together with I know not how many other goodly epithets which have bin but too liberally bestowed on them. They are said, to have kept within the bounds of decency, to have argued close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly without heat and passion, to have confuted their Adversaries opinions, without railing at their persons. They stand closely upon their guard, warily defend themselves, without giving advantage to their enemies by any loose and unwarrantable expressions, which <hi>passion</hi> is apt to suggest when <hi>reason and sound Argument</hi> is wanting; and in one word, they are said to have set a pattern of writing Controversies to the world.</p>
                  <p>If this be so, and that we can reconcile this character with those expressions which have now bin cited out of their books; then I think we have lost all distinction between <hi>modesty and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, rudeness and decency, truth and calumny.</hi> For I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any man of the greatest wit, in conjunction with the greatest
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62459:127"/> malice, to forge and utter any thing against us and our Religion, nay tho the Devil himself were at the elbow of the writer, which can exceed what these men charge us with, in point of <hi>falshood and virulence.</hi> One of the heavyest charges which was of old drawn up against the Christians, and laid at their doors, was, that in their assemblies they were wont to murder an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and out of sport and wantonnels to drink up his blood; so that their <hi>Love-feasts,</hi> as they called them, were indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but so many <hi>Thyestean banquets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if what our adversaries affirm of us and our Religion be true, we doe much worse: for what those men might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to do out of <hi>frenzy and distraction,</hi> (for who but frantick and wild people would be guilty of such lewd pranks?) the Guides of the Church have done out of <hi>contrivance and design;</hi> who have bin engaged in a wicked combination for about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ages, to delude and cheat the world, and that in a matter of highest consequence, relating to the <hi>honor of God,</hi> and the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens Souls,</hi> which they have disregarded in comparison of their own interest, and secular designs.</p>
                  <p>For what proportion do the lives of a few Infants bear to the Souls of so many millions, whom the Christian Doctors, by infusing so many loose and impious opinions into the minds of their followers, have, <hi>as far as in them lay,</hi> led to eternal perdition? For tho these opinions in themselves, should not <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and inevitably</hi> occasion the ruine of those who embrace them; yet they bring them, as our adversaries tell the world, into great hazard, being mighty obstacles to mens happyness, and do very naturally and easily turn them out of the way which leads to eternal life. And if so, then we cannot but conclude, <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>But tho they have taken different ways, yet they both agree
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62459:130"/> in one common end, and have bin but too successful in attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, <hi>viz.</hi> The weakening that esteem and reputation in which our Religion formerly was held, and which it always deserves, in the world. For the reproaches which these men have cast upon us, have bin greedily pickt up by the <hi>loose and the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> of the Age, and are with great satisfaction, indeed with a kind of triumph bandyed among them in their clubs and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And the pernicious effects of this are every day too visible, insomuch that we find some <hi>ridiculing</hi> the mysteries of our Faith▪ others with great vehemence <hi>opposing</hi> them; and a strange <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> hath diffused it self among divers others; who tho they have not forsaken the profession of the Faith, yet have in great measure shaken off the reverence and concern which they should have for it: so that they are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (if I may be allowed to use that word in the sense as some have taken and rendered it,) do as it were in <hi>procinctu stare,</hi> being in a very good dispo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition and forwardness, ready to receive any Religion either <hi>with, or without Creeds,</hi> with or without <hi>Sacraments</hi> and a <hi>Ministry,</hi> if that can be called Religion, where these are wanting.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, for my own part, I am of opinion, that <hi>Celsus,</hi> and <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> may as well be proposed for decent patterns of writing, as these our Adversaries: for there is no expression so rash, no calumnies so virulent, no language so rude and boysterous, which they do not make use of upon this occasion, in order to defame our Religion, and discredit the professors and maintainers of it. Neither is it enough to say, what sometimes is offered in excuse of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they do not rail against <hi>persons,</hi> but <hi>opinions:</hi> that they shew a respect to their <hi>Adversaries</hi> at the same time that they thus warmly condemn their <hi>errors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, though it should be allowed, which is not always true, that they do not revile their particular adversaries when they write against them, yet they speak very opprobriously of Christians in general, and of the Doctors and Fathers of the Church; in which they have bin but too much imitated by the <hi>Remonstrants.</hi> And this I think is more criminal; forasmuch as the reputation of bodies and communities of men, is more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62459:130"/> sacred, and ought therefore to be had in greater regard than that of particular persons.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> (which is a consideration of infinitely greater weight in this case) it ought to be remembred, and our Adversaries can never be too often charged with it: that tho they should really observe that good temper in their writings, as never to use the least disrespectful expression towards any man; yet they can never be excused for those <hi>blasphemous expressions,</hi> which with great boldness and impiety are uttered by them <note n="1" place="bottom">And among them hear what the wise <hi>Socinus</hi> saith, (that great pattern of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Prudence, and Moderation) who passes this modest and decent Reflection upon those opinions which prevail in the Christian Church, concerning the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and which are accounted the main and fundamental Articles of our Religion. <hi>Verum sperandum est, ut non secus atque portentosa ista Sophist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And then as to the <hi>spirit of God,</hi> the third person in the blessed Trinity, they speak of him with yet much greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; not only degrading him from his divinity, but deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his subsistence and personality: sometimes accounting him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62459:131"/> only an <hi>accident,</hi> either a <hi>quality,</hi> or <hi>an operation;</hi> at other times in a most detestable manner, styling him a mere <hi>vapor</hi>

Upon these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I confess, I have not without some surprize and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, perused certain passages of late, and <note n="2" place="bottom">

                     </note> heretofore published in commendation of these men; and particularly of the strength and clearness of their reasoning, of their candor and fairness, in the managements of their disputes against us. What can any man think that compares those Elogies, and these expressions transcribed out of their writings? For my own part I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I cannot imagine what good end can be served by such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable and extravagant commendations. On the other hand, I am sure, they do but furnish people with occasion of suspicion that their admirers, out of love and fondness to their persons, without consulting their books, have overhastily ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to represent them to the world, under these advantageous Characters: or else men may be apt to think much worse, (which yet charity I presume will forbid them to imagine;) that they have not that due regard for the Religion which they profess, or the blessed Author of it as becomes them: both which have bin thus violently assaulted, with all the <hi>ill arts,</hi> and all the <hi>ill language</hi> which wit heightened with malice could suggest.</p>
                  <p>The second reason which induced me so largely to insist upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62459:131"/> those calumnies, and that charge which these men have drawn up against our Holy Faith, and the professors of it, was, that I might hereby justifie the endeavors of all such who either by <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>writing,</hi> by <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> (and Gods blessing rest upon them who make use of their authority to so good a purpose) make it their business to oppose the attempts of these men, and to stop the growth of their pernicious errors, which have but too far spread themselves amongst us. For if we have any regard for the honor of God, the welfare of our Religion, or our own reputation, we have just reason to be engaged in this vindication; for all these suffer in those unjust aspersions which they in their writings perpetually cast upon us.</p>
                  <p>Many things well deserve to be spoken on this subject, which I shall defer at present, and reserve them to be mentioned in the conclusion of this discourse: only there is one thing which is fit to be insisted upon here, as being pertinent to my present design, and will help to make good the charge which I drew up against them in the beginning of this discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> that hereby they doe, tho not directly oppose, yet secretly undermine the authority of the Holy Scriptures; and give men just cause, if what they say be true, not only to suspect, but plainly to deny their truth and inspiration. For if the Articles and mysteries of our Faith are, as we say, <hi>revealed in the holy Scriptures;</hi> and if those very my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, are, as our adversaries say, such <hi>absurd, impious, monstrous, blasphemous</hi> opinions; it must by a direct and necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence follow from hence, that the Scriptures are so far from having God for their Author, that no honest or wise man could be concerned in the composing and publishing of them.</p>
                  <p>It will be said, that these Doctrines are not to be found in the holy Scriptures, but are rather the inventions and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>fanciful and injudicious</hi> men, to say no worse of them. Now how shall this matter be cryed? We have always affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Religion is plainly revealed in the Bible; that we found it there, and took it thence. They say, it is not contained in the Holy writings, and can never be proved out of them. If we refer men to the plain and express words of Scripture, and bid them make use of their eies, and peruse
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62459:132"/> what is written there, and then upon a fair perusal, believe the report of their understandings in this affair: then our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries tell us, that we ought not always to collect Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, from the <hi>Words and Letter</hi> of the Scriptures, but from the <hi>sense and meaning</hi> of them; which may, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is really very different, from what the words and letter at first view may seem to import. But how shall we be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that this is so in this case, and that by forsaking the plain, obvious, natural construction of the words, we shall not deviate from the design and intention of the holy writers? In certain matters which are disputed between us, we say the words of Scripture are to be taken in the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> sense: our Adversaries to avoid the evidence and conviction which arises hence, betake themselves to <hi>Tropes and Metaphors.</hi> How shall this matter I say be determined?</p>
                  <p>Now one would think, that the fairest proposal that can possibly be made in this case, is, that it should be referred to the arbitration of those who lived in, or next to the Age in which the Apostles and other holy writers lived, who either upon their own knowledge, or by the writings and discourses of such who conversed with the holy Pen-men, might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their true sense and meaning: and consequently we, who live at this great distance from the Apostolical age, by perusing the writings of the Ancients, and finding what was their sense in these controverted points, may be able to form a judgment concerning those Doctrines, which are now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed and embraced among Christians; whether they really are the same with those that were at first preached by the Apostles, and entertained by their Disciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
                  <p>Here we have brought this matter to a short issue, if our Adversaries would join with us upon this head. But they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely decline it, for this reason, <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>Many scandalous reflections upon this occasion are by our adversaries cast upon the first and best ages of the Church, and those great men who lived in them, whose names and writings are transmitted down to us,; whereby, not only the <hi>wisdom and integrity</hi> of the Fathers are called in question, but with them, the <hi>Authority and Inspiration</hi> of the holy Scriptures are dangerously shocked, and by these means brought into great doubt and uncertainty, as shall hereafter be made more largely to appear.</p>

But of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this head: The <hi>Socinians</hi> sometimes tell us, as we heard before, that our doctrines concerning the <hi>Trinity and Incarnation,</hi> are the great hindrances of the propagation of the Gospel among <hi>Pagans and Mahometans;</hi> and therefore, that in order to gain <hi>Proselytes</hi> to our Religion, we ought to part with the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our Faith, which are the great stumbling block in the way of these Infidels. But I say this alone will not be effectual to the purpose, as long as we retain the Scriptures, where these doctrines are very plainly contained; and where <hi>Jews and Mahometans</hi> will be sure to find them. Neither is it to be imagined, that in the interpretation of Scripture, they will ever be governed by the <hi>figurative and sophistical</hi> expositions of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> against the <hi>plain natural</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62459:134"/> signification of the words. You may as soon prevail with them to part with their <hi>senses,</hi> and make them believe the words are not to be found in the Scriptures, as perswade them that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived sense and meaning is not there likewise. And therefore upon occasion, some of them have declared, that if they could but believe the truth of the writings of the <hi>New Testament;</hi> they would soon believe the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Savior, and would adore and invocate him as God.</p>
                  <p>In short, to gain the good opinion of Infidels, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them to our Religion, we must not only part with our Articles, but likewise turn <hi>Traditors,</hi> and deliver up our <hi>Bibles.</hi> And then perhaps, in complyance wiht so great and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a complement, they may receive us into their friendship.</p>
                  <p>Having thus seen what opinion the <hi>Socinians</hi> have of the <hi>Doctrines and Mysteries</hi> of our Faith: I now proceede to shew what it is that they say of the <hi>grace</hi> of Faith, and the act of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi> And here upon examination we shall find that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain as low, mean thoughts of the habit and grace of Faith, as they do of the objects of it.

Admit it brings some small advantages with it, yet the want or absence of it will be attended with no great inconvenience. You may say of it, as one did of the skill or art of Poetry, <hi>si adest, laudo, si abest, non multum vitupero.</hi> In short, what the Apostle affirms of meats 1 <hi>Cor. 8. v.</hi> 8. may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually verified of Faith, <hi>It commendeth us not to God, for neither if we believe, are we the better, neither if we believe not, are we the worse: mode vitae sanctimonia salva sit,</hi> provided you preserve a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for holyness, and live a good life.</p>

                  <p>Now this is contrary to the express declarations of the holy Scriptures, in which we find <hi>Faith and Obedience</hi> very often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished; as certainly they are, in all those places which make Faith the <hi>cause and principle</hi> of new obedience, as when it is said, that <hi>FAith purifieth the Heart,</hi> Acts 15. 9. that <hi>it worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. Now the cause and the effect, can never be one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62459:135"/> and the same thing; otherwise the greatest contradictions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable must from thence follow: As, that the same thing may be, and may not be at the same time; may be before, and after it self. In short, there is no ill consequence that can justly be charged upon <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which exceeds those, in point either of <hi>absurdity or danger,</hi> which are lodged in the bowels of this assertion, viz. <hi>that good works are the formal notion of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This renders the Apostle trifling in his exhortation, and guilty of such weakness and vanity, as were not to be excused in the most trivial Writers. <hi>This is a faithful saying,</hi> saith he to Titus, <hi>and this I will that thou affirm constantly, that they who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works,</hi> Tit. 3. 8. Why should the Apostle make use of such a solemn preface, and urge in so emphatical a manner, that which when examined, amounts to so mean and empty a tautology: It being as if he should have said, I require thee to charge men solemnly, and often to put them in mind of this matter of great importance, <hi>viz.</hi> that they who obey the commandments of Christ, should be sure to be obedient to them. Indeed, if he had said, I require that they who already <hi>do good works,</hi> should be sure to <hi>persevere</hi> in them; there might be room and reason for such a command and admonition. Otherwise, if faith and obedience are not to be distinguished, there could be no ground in this place for this exhortation. <hi>I will shew thee my faith by my works,</hi> saith St. James, 2 <hi>James 18. v.</hi> A very notable discovery indeed, if these two are but one and the same thing; <hi>viz.</hi> that a man should discover his works by his operations, and demonstrate his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by his conformity to the Laws of Christ. It is true indeed, a lively and a firm faith cannot be seperated from good works: but however it may, and must be distinguished from them, as the cause and principle from the Effect, the root from the branches. Otherwise we shall turn things upside down; make no account whether the foundation or building be uppermost, and thereby occasion a strange and wild con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the order of Nature and Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62459:135"/>
                  <p>I shall farther acknowledge, that faith, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> or a <hi>Metonymie</hi> rather, sometimes comprehends not only the <hi>persuasion</hi> of the mind concerning the truths of the Gospel, but likewise all that, which by a necessity either Natural or Moral flows from it: and so it may be allowed (as our Divines have rightly stated this matter) to take within its compass the consent of the understanding, together with the affections of the mind, and those actions likewise which are consequent to a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. Yet so, that in the first place, in its primary and most natural signification, it denotes the assent of the understanding: and therefore by no means, without great injustice, as well as absurdity, can faith be taken to signifie the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, so as to exclude the former, which is the cause and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of it. For <hi>obedience</hi> is no otherwise to be styled <hi>faith,</hi> but because it flows from <hi>faith;</hi> that is, when the truths of the Gospel make such a deep and lasting impression on the mind, as thereby to influence the life and practice.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that the Socinians will make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to acknowledge, that this faith or perswasion of the mind, is antecedent to obedience and the principle of it: but that they do not conceive it to be any otherwise useful or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, than as it respects the <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62459:136"/>
                  <p>Now this I say, is directly repugnant to the plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press declarations of the holy Scriptures, which describe faith in Christ to be a firm perswasion of the truth of certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions concerning Christ, which are grounded upon his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and either respect his <hi>Offices,</hi> or relate to his <hi>Person.</hi> And this faith is required of us as a virtue highly commendable in it self, and an especial Instrument of our Salvation: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>necessary condition</hi> required of us antecedently to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the benefits and priviledges which our blessed Saviour hath purchased for us. In short, we are required to believe him to be the <hi>Christ, the son of God, the Saviour of the world.</hi> For God did not think fit to dispense those great blessings which have been procured for us to any, but such as should own and acknowledge him <hi>from whom</hi> they are derived; as also by <hi>what means</hi> they were at first obtained, and <hi>by which</hi> they are still to be applyed. And therefore they that thus believe, viz. <hi>that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God;</hi> are said to <hi>be born of God,</hi> 1 John 5. 1. <hi>To dwell in God, and God in them,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 15. <hi>To over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 5. To be as sure of everlasting life as if they were in actual possession of it. <hi>He that believeth in the son of God hath everlasting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. On the other hand, they who do not thus believe on him, are said to <hi>make God a lyar, because they believe not the record which God gave of his son,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10. who hath declared more than once by a voice from Heaven, that he was <hi>his beloved son.</hi> Nay, hereby they do not only dishonour God, but bring also inevitable ruine upon their own Souls; being already <hi>under condemnation and the wrath of God abiding on them,</hi> 3 Joh. 18. 36.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the sense of the Scriptures concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which all along put a great stress upon Faith, as it bespeaks the assent of the understanding, and persuasion of the mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truths of the Gospel, and particularly this great truth that <hi>Jesus is the Son of God.</hi> And this alone might be abundantly sufficient to convince any honest and unprejudic'd mind, not only of the <hi>usefulness,</hi> but likewise of the <hi>absolute and indispensable necessity</hi> of believing. But forasmuch as this is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great importance, in which the honor of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62459:136"/> the truth and authority of the holy writings, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those of the <hi>New Testament;</hi> the excellence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the certainty of the Christian Religion, are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: I shall farther inlarge upon this Head, and endeavour to lay before the Reader sundry of those evil and pernicious consequences, which are included in, and unavoidably follow from the contrary opinion, which makes faith either an <hi>useless,</hi> or at best but an <hi>indifferent</hi> matter.</p>
                  <p>And first I say, this opinion tends plainly to the dishonor of our blessed Savior, and to weaken that veneration which every one who is called by his name ought to have for him: To have just and right conceptions of him, being the first act of honor, and the foundation of all other expressions of homage and duty which we owe him; and therefore if we have not a true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and knowledge of him as to his <hi>nature and essence,</hi> it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us with any <hi>certainty,</hi> or with any <hi>safety,</hi> to pay him that adoration and service which may be claimed from us.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account, we find him in his Sermons and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, making it his business to inform the people upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion▪ of his <hi>nature, descent, and original:</hi> always declaring that he was <hi>the son of God,</hi> that <hi>God was his Father,</hi> that he was <hi>the Messiah</hi> the Savior of the World, that he <hi>came from God,</hi> that he was the <hi>living bread which came down from Heaven.</hi> Nay he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear witness of himself, but for the farther confirmation of this great truth he appeals to the Scriptures, <hi>Jo. 5. 39. which testified of him;</hi> to the <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought <hi>v.</hi> 36. which proclaimed his Divinity, and were a clear proof of the truth of all that he had averred of himselfe; to the testimony of <hi>John Baptist</hi> v. 33. <hi>who bare witness unto this truth. For he saw the Spirit descending from Heaven and remaining on him,</hi> 1 Jo. 33. And what he saw himself he published to others, and bare <hi>record that he was the son of God</hi> v. 34. Nay to place this truth above the reach of all doubt, he appeals, as to the last and greatest confirmation that could possibly be given of it, to the Testimony of his Father who sent him <hi>v.</hi> 37. and by a voice from Heaven more then once <hi>bare witness of him,</hi> and declared that he <hi>was his well beloved Son, Mat.</hi> 3. 17. &amp; 17. 5.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62459:137"/>
                  <p>Now to what purpose should our Savior take all this pains to informe his Hearers, so often to inculcate, and by so many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to confirm this matter, if it were not of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, highly fiting to be made known, and therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed? And therefore we find that he was desirous to know, if I may so say, not only what effect his <hi>doctrine</hi> had upon the minds of his hearers, but what opinion they had of his <hi>person, whom doe men say that I the son of man am?</hi> Mat. 16. 13. The same question he repeats to his Disciples, that they might declare their apprehensions of him, <hi>but whom say ye that I am?</hi> v. 15. To the man cured of his blindness <hi>Jo.</hi> 9. 35. the question that he puts to him in order to his being admitted one of his Disciples, was, <hi>dost thou believe on the son of God?</hi> which Faith plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected the <hi>person,</hi> and not directly or immediately the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Christ.</hi> For the answer returned, was not which be those commands, but who is that person, <hi>v. 36. who is he Lord that I might believe on him?</hi> And upon this discovery made by our Savior of himself <hi>v.</hi> 37. the blind man declares his Faith and acknowledgment of him, that he was <hi>the son of God;</hi> and as a sign of his inward Faith, he pays his outward adoration <hi>Lord I believe and he worshiped him, v.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>Thus, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his Faith did not consist formally in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but in the acknowledgment of Christs person, <hi>Jo. 20. 28. My Lord and my God.</hi> And this perswasion of the mind, and confession of the mouth, which is the consequence and proof of the former, is not only a duty, but a duty so acceptable to God, that our Savior more than once pronounces <hi>a blessing</hi> to it; first here in his discourse with <hi>Thomas v. 29. because thou hast seen; thou hast believed; blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> Where the word <hi>Believe</hi> in the Antithesis, must be taken in the same sense as it is used in the former part. Now in the former it is plain, it is used to denote the assent of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; for St. <hi>Thomas</hi> his infidelity did not consist in <hi>immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and disobedience,</hi> but in a <hi>distrust</hi> of the truth of what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had related concerning the resurrection of Christ. His faith consequently consisted in an <hi>assent to and acknowledgment</hi> of what he before doubted. The same blessing, and for the same
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62459:137"/> reason our Saviour pronounces to St. <hi>Peter; viz.</hi> for his glorious Confession and acknowledgement of his Divinity, Matt. 16. 17. <hi>Blessed art thou Simon Bar-jona, for flesh and hlood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, and therefore must be acknowledged, that this perswasion of the mind, and a Confession consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of the Divine Nature of Christ, without a <hi>Conformity to his Laws,</hi> will not be sufficient to recommend us to the favour of God, and to give us a title to the blessing pronounced to them who believe. But this will not overthrow the truth of what I have now asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> that faith in this sense as we now take it, is a duty highly acceptable to God, and of as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary obligation, as is any other of the graces of Gods Spirit, tho none of them <hi>in separation</hi> from the rest will give us a title to happiness. For instance: <hi>Temperance and Chastity</hi> are virtues highly commendable in themselves, and therefore serve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to the favour of God; but if they are found in any person, where <hi>truth and justice</hi> are wanting, they alone, without these latter virtues will never procure us a reward. Yet however, this will not hinder, but that these good qualities, are, as we said before, in themselves very acceptable to God, and of necessary and indispensable obligation.</p>
                  <p>The case is the very same with faith. If any man therefore should put the question from St. James, <hi>2d. ch. 14. v.</hi> and ask, <hi>if a man have faith, and have not works, can that faith save him?</hi> I Ans. by no means: we may roundly and peremptorily declare that this faith, tho' it should be joined with <hi>fiducia,</hi> a <hi>strong confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or if you please, a <hi>recumbency</hi> on Christ, will not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not save him. But will it therefore follow, that it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and absolutely required of us? No, this can as little be allowed as the former. That which can reasonably be collected from hence is, not that it is not <hi>necessary,</hi> but that it is not <hi>the only thing</hi> that is so. I know it will be here said, that this faith, as it is terminated in the person of Christ, doth not properly respect his <hi>Nature,</hi> but only or chiefly <hi>his Offices.</hi> So that when we are so often required in the Scriptures to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ,</hi> the meaning of it is, that we should believe him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62459:138"/> to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> without troubling our selves or others with any curious but needless enquiries after his <hi>Nature and Essence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Scriptures declare the contrary, that it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to make an acknowledgement of <hi>his Office,</hi> without the knowledge of <hi>his Nature;</hi> as is evident from those places before mentioned, wherein he is declared, and we are therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to believe him to be <hi>the son of God:</hi> the writings of the New Testament, every where laying a particular stress on this phrase, and requiring of us to believe in him, in this determinate sense and notion; <hi>viz.</hi> That he whom we own to be our Savior, Jesus Christ, <hi>is the son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was that which he allways averred and declared of himself. The same likewise was constantly affirmed and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Apostles; firmly and universally believed by all his friends, and followers; objected against him by his enemies, and drawn up into an accusation and charge by the Jews. <hi>We have a Law</hi> (say they) <hi>and by that Law he ought to dye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he made himself the son of God,</hi> Jo. 19. 7. Nay the very Devils proclaimed this great truth, unwillingly to be sure, but yet publickly and loudly they declared, what at the same time they trembled at the mention of, proving the Heralds of his Divinity; for <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 11. we are told, <hi>that unclean Spirits when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, thou art the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it will here be replyed by some, that it is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we are obliged in Scripture to confess and acknowledge our Savior to be <hi>the Son of God:</hi> but by this phrase is meant no more, but that we should believe him to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> these being Synonymous terms, both the one and the other of them serving to denote to us, not the <hi>nature,</hi> but the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> of our blessed Savior, and particularly his office of being our King, so that to believe him to be the <hi>son of God,</hi> imports no more than to acknowledge him to be the <hi>Messiah:</hi> That is, to submit to his Authority, to own him for our Soveraign, and our selves for his Subjects; and in pursuance thereof, to promise all due submission to his Regal power, and obedience to his Laws.</p>

                  <p>I Ans. therefore, that these two phrases of being the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> and the <hi>son of God</hi> are not equipollent phrases, nor have they therefore the same formal import and signification; the one properly denoting the <hi>Nature,</hi> and the other the <hi>Offices</hi> of our Savior. It is true indeed, they are often joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but the reason why they are so joyned is, because the <hi>nature</hi> and the <hi>office</hi> did meet in the same person. He who was the <hi>Messiah</hi> was truely the <hi>son of God:</hi> and none but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he who was thus the son of God, could execute the office of the Messiah. But however the formal notion of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets given our Savior is different, as denoting and signifying
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62459:139"/> two different things; as will appear from these following considerations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> that to be the <hi>son of▪ God</hi> plainly denotes the nature and essence; but to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the office of our Savior, as was said before. And this will appear from the writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> where we find these two Titles, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and the <hi>son of God,</hi> very plainly distinguished: without which distinction we cannot clear the Scriptures from the imputation of needless, and sometimes absurd repetitions. For tho in some places, these phrases may seem to be so joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, as if they were <hi>Equivalent,</hi> and only <hi>Exegetical</hi> of each other; yet in others they are placed in such a manner of distinction, that they cannot be supposed to be of the same import, without allowing a manifest and a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Tautology.</p>
                  <p>And thus (for instance) they are distinguished in the Eunuch's answer to the question of <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. 37. <hi>I believe</hi> (saith he) <hi>that Jesus Christ is the son of God; or that the son of God is Jesus Christ▪</hi> (for so the words as they stand in the Original, may be reciprocally rendred) yet in both cases, the one of these stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the place of a <hi>subject,</hi> and the other of a <hi>praedicate,</hi> they cannot denote the same thing, without supposing, that the grave and solemn profession which this new Convert made of his Faith, should consist in a ludicrous, because Identical predication: It being at this rate no other than if he should have said, I believe that Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version▪ in the Synagogues at <hi>Damascus,</hi> is said to have <hi>preached Christ</hi> among the Jews that were there; and the substance of what he Preached was, that <hi>he was the son of God,</hi> Acts 9. 20. The like confession of his Faith was made by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and in the name of the rest of the Apostles, Jo. 6. 69. <hi>We believe and are sure, that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as when the Scriptures inform us, that some believed, and others proved and demonstrated that <hi>Jesus was the Christ;</hi> it must from thence be evident, that to be <hi>Jesus,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> must signify two distinct things; for the same thing cannot,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62459:139"/> except very foolishly and impertinently, be affirmed, and much less be demonstrated of it self. So when the same holy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings acquaint us, that some persons in the solemn declarations of their faith, professed that <hi>Jesus Christ was the son of God;</hi> and that others by reason and argument, made it their business to prove and demonstrate him to be so: we ought to conceive, that to be <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and to be the <hi>son of God,</hi> are two phrases that import two different things: otherwise we cannot acquit those holy men who made those professions, and were engaged in that proof, from the imputation of folly and impertinence.</p>
                  <p>Once more, if these places should not be sufficient to silence the Cavils of our Adversaries, yet one would think that the words of St. <hi>John, ch. 20. v.</hi> 31. should put it beyond all doubt. In which the Apostle gives an account of the reason that moved and induced him to commit to writing the History of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors life and actions, <hi>viz.</hi> that we might be thereby prevail'd on <hi>to believe that Jesus is the Christ,</hi> and not only so, but that he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was <hi>the son of God.</hi> By which phrase, it is plain that he meant to assert the divine nature and Godhead of our Savior; the proof and vindication of which, against the impious Opinion of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus,</hi> who denyed his Divinity, was the chief design of our Apostle and Evangelist in writing his Gospel, as <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Lib. 3. Cap. 11.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Ireneus</hi> and <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Catal. Script. Ecclesiast.</hi> And the same is affirmed by <hi>Euseb. viz.</hi> that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Gospel to assert the Divinity of our Savior; tho he doth not make mention of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> his Heresy as the occasion of his writing. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Euseb. Hist. Eccl. Lib. 3. Cap. 24.</hi>
                     </note> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> assure us.</p>
                  <p>And this distinction the Jews very plainly and clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For when our Savior assumed to himself the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being the son of God, they took his meaning to be, that he thereby professed himself to be the <hi>natural son of God,</hi> and not only a son <hi>by adoption</hi> and favor, as he must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be, if he were no otherwise the <hi>son of God,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the <hi>Messiah.</hi> For the consequences which they drew from this affirmation of his could not agree to one who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62459:140"/> was only a son by adoption. For <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 18. by saying that <hi>God was his Father</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his own proper Father in a peculiar, sense, they drew this conclusion, that he made himself <hi>equal to God, i. e.</hi> of the same nature and substance; otherwise it was not possible to suppose any such equality. So again <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 30. by his affirming that <hi>He and his Father were one;</hi> they infer, and infer rightly, that he thereby plainly <hi>made himself God,</hi> v. 33.</p>
                  <p>Once more at his arraignment before <hi>Pilate,</hi> these two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of his, that he was <hi>Christ,</hi> and that he was the <hi>son of God,</hi> gave occasion for a double charge and indictment against him. Both indeed by the Jews were accounted Capital Crimes, but yet of a different nature: the one being a crime against the State, the other against God and Religion. For in that he said he was <hi>Christ a King,</hi> this they improved into an accusation of High Treason, <hi>Luke 23. 2. we found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbiding to give Tribute to</hi> Caesar, <hi>saying that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is Christ a King.</hi> So Jo. 19. 12. <hi>whosoever maketh himself a King, speaketh against Caesar.</hi> But in that he said he was the <hi>son of God,</hi> this was allways by them accounted <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and a sin directly and immediately against God. The High priest when he heard that he owned himself to be the son of God, and that as such, he should <hi>sit on the right hand of power, rent his Clothes, and said that he Blasphemed,</hi> Math. 26. 64, 65. And Jo. 19. 7. <hi>we have a law, and by that law he ought to dye, because he made himself the son of God.</hi> From all which it appears, that to be the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to be <hi>the son of God,</hi> signify two different things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not equipollent terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> This will farther appear from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior was <hi>the son of God before</hi> he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and therefore these two phrases cannot denote the same thing. He was not the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as that bespeaks him to be a Mediator between God and men, before the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> nor was he so, as to the actual and complete execution of that office, for many ages after; even till his assuming our nature, and his being born and brought forth into the world. But he was the <hi>son of God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> nay, <hi>before the foundations of the Earth and the World were laid, even from everlasting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62459:140"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly,</hi> The ground and foundation of these two titles is vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different: the one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of his being the son of God, being founded in an <hi>eternal generation;</hi> the other, that of his being the Messiah, <hi>in designation and appointment,</hi> and a mutual agreement between him and his father.</p>
                  <p>Which furnisheth us with a <hi>4th,</hi> and an unanswerable reason against this assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> was but a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> and therefore in it self a <hi>contingent matter,</hi> and that in two respects, the first whereof respects the fall and misery of man, which was antecedent to his redemption and recovery: so that if man had not sinned, as he might not (his sin being the result of his own freedom and choice) the <hi>son of God</hi> would never have been the <hi>Messiah.</hi> The second respects the gracious, but free pleasure of God. For after man had sinned, he might and must have been irrecoverably ruined and undone for ever, had not God in great compassion found out a way for his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: which deliverance was the result of meer mercy, and founded in mutual but voluntary compact between the Father and the Son, as was said before. But that our Savior should be the <hi>son of God,</hi> this did not depend upon <hi>arbitrary consent and pleasure;</hi> but upon a <hi>natural, necessary, and therefore an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess these three last reasons will signify little with a <hi>Socinian,</hi> who denys any other nature in Christ, then that which he had, and received in the womb of the Virgin; or any existence, antecedent to his Birth and appearance in the world. But however they must be of irresistible force against all others, who agree with the <hi>Socinians</hi> in this notion, and yet acknowledge the Divinity and eternal generation of our Savior; who was therefore the son of God, both <hi>before,</hi> and for a <hi>reason</hi> vastly different from that whereby he was constituted the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as is fully and plainly acknowledged by <hi>Episcopius;</hi> who yet in direct opposition to that acknowledgment, confounds these two titles, which ought very carefully to be distinguished. But he did it to serve a very ill purpose: not indeed to impugne the truth and certainty of this great Article concerning the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, but to overthrow the <hi>necessity of believing it;</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:62459:141"/> and thereby he dangerously weakens, not to say undermines that important truth, which he had before not only plainly affirmed, but likewise very clearly, and I think unanswerably vindicated.</p>
                  <p>I say he hereby <hi>weakens</hi> that great Article of our Faith; and the reason why I say so, is this, because if Christ be God, as he grants he is, it can be for no other reason, but because he is the <hi>natural and eternal son of God, begotten of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds:</hi> by which eternal generation he had the divine nature communicated to him, and thereby became truly and properly God. If any man therefore shall say, that the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> of our Savior is not included in that style and phrase of his being called the <hi>son of God,</hi> I must aver that by so saying, he doth not only weaken, but by consequence subvert, as one of the clearest, so likewise the fundamental proof of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All other proofs of it which are taken from the <hi>name, operations,</hi> and <hi>perfections of the Deity,</hi> which are ascribed to him in the Scriptures, being founded upon this Title and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by it.</p>
                  <p>For when he is called <hi>God,</hi> and the Divine works and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are ascribed to him, we must not think that he is God <hi>distinct</hi> from his Father, but <hi>one</hi> with him, partaker of the same divine nature and essence. Neither must he be supposed to have this divine nature and essence <hi>of and from himself,</hi> but from the Father, of <hi>whom he was begotten before all Worlds.</hi> In short, if he be not the son of God by a <hi>true and essential generation,</hi> then it is certain that he is not God. But if he be God by virtue of his being the <hi>son of God,</hi> then whenever we own and profess him to be that <hi>Son,</hi> we must at the same time allow, that the divine nature and substance was communicated to him from all Eternity, by a true, proper, tho mysterious and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable Generation; <hi>for who can declare it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I say the divine nature was communicated to him from the Father, I mean the same <hi>individual, numerical divine nature and substance;</hi> and so must every one else mean, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges and rightly believes the eternal Generation of the Son. By which phrase we understand, and therefore are obliged
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62459:141"/> to believe, that the son of God was not made or created, <hi>ex ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilo,</hi> as the <hi>Arians</hi> of old blasphemously affirmed; but <hi>begotten of the substance of his Father;</hi> not <hi>by</hi> the substance, that is, by the Omnipotent substantial power of the Father, for in that sense the whole world, and every thing in it, may be said to be produced <hi>by</hi> the substance or substantial power of God the Father; but <hi>ex substantia, of</hi> his substance, which was, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, communicated to him from all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Now the substance of one person, whether finite or infinite, cannot be communicated to another, but either <hi>in part,</hi> or <hi>in whole:</hi> no other way of communication is conceivable. When the substance is communicated but in part, as it is in all finite Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whether of men, or other Animals and plants, (and it is impossible it should be otherwise there) then this partial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is the foundation of a <hi>specifical likeness</hi> or Identity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the person begetting and the person begotten; and because the Father cannot communicate his whole essence and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to his Son, therefore it is impossible that the son can be <hi>consubstantial</hi> to his Father, (I speak of men) <hi>i. e.</hi> partaker of the same numerical humane nature; for if so, the Father and Son would be but one and the same man. But because the son is so begotten of the substance of his father, as to be partaker of it only in part, out of which part his complete essence and nature is made and framed; (the same indeed <hi>in kind,</hi> but yet <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> distinguished from that of his father) therefore the father and the son to all intents and purposes must not only be two distinct persons, but likewise two different men.</p>
                  <p>But in the Divine Generation things are quite otherwise. For here, because it is repugnant to the infinite perfections of the divine nature, to be <hi>divided or separated into parts;</hi> therefore, if it be communicated from the father to the son, as the Scriptures assure us it is, then it must be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated whole and entire, without <hi>repetition or multiplication,</hi> and consequently without the <hi>least difference and distinction.</hi> And therefore the Fathers when they speak of this divine and ineffable generation of the son of God, teach us carefully to avoid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining in our imagination, any mean and cornoreal represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62459:142"/> of this matter; we must not think of any <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, any <hi>division, section,</hi> or <hi>separation of parts;</hi> but we must believe that the whole divine nature is perfectly and entirely communicated from the father to the son; which because it can neither be <hi>divided,</hi> nor <hi>multiplied,</hi> nor consequently <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> therefore it must be the same <hi>numerical, individual nature</hi> in both, without the least imaginable difference or distinction, as was said before.</p>
                  <p>In short, they who assert only a <hi>specifical Identity</hi> of nature in the father and son, must either with the <hi>Arians</hi> affirm, that the Son was made <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>non natus, sed factus,</hi> that God the Father, by his Almighty power, created a divine person like himself, and formed him out of nothing: or else they must believe that but <hi>part</hi> of the divine nature, as in human genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was communicated to him, out of which his whole essence and substance was framed: whereby he became a God of the <hi>same kind</hi> with his Father, but not of the same individual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with him. Either of which affirmations, must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely erroneous, and directly repugnant both to natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and revealed religion.</p>
                  <p>By all that hath been said, it is evident, that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior affirmed of himself, and his Apostles afterwards, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of the commission which they received from him, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and declared to the world, that he was the <hi>son of God,</hi> meant, that he was the <hi>natural son of God,</hi> partaker of the same divine nature and substance with his Father, and therefore truly and properly <hi>God.</hi> Now the same persons, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ himself and his Apostles, do not only plainly declare him to be the son of God, but as plainly and positively require us to believe him to be so, and that under no less a penalty than eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So our Savior himself, Jo. 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned allready, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God.</hi> and v. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> So his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and particularly the beloved Disciple, who rested his head in the bosom of his master, and knew his mind and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well I dare say, as <hi>Grotius,</hi> or <hi>Episcopius,</hi> or any the most
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62459:142"/> Learned Interpreter of Scripture that ever was in the world; this beloved Apostle I say, is very copious and pathetical in urging the necessity of this faith, which we are now speaking of, 1 Jo. 4. 15. <hi>Whosoever confesseth that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Again, <hi>who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God?</hi> ch. 5. 5.</p>
                  <p>This was the main scope and design of all his writings, to form in men a perswasion and acknowledgment of this truth. <hi>These are written,</hi> (saith he, speaking of our Savior's appearing to his Disciples after his resurrection, and the things which he spake and did in their presence) <hi>that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing, ye might have life through his name,</hi> Jo. 20. 31. And <hi>these things,</hi> saith he in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Epistle directed to all the Churches, <hi>have I written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that ye might believe on the name of the son of God,</hi> 1 Jo. 5. 13.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, and must not be denyed, that our Savior is in the Scriptures styled the son of God upon other accounts than this that we are now insisting on, <hi>viz.</hi> his eternal generation. But then I say, it matters not upon how many accounts, and for what other reasons he may be called the <hi>son of God,</hi> provided it be acknowledged, as it is by the persons with whom we are now disputing, that he is truly and properly so called, because he is the <hi>natural and eternal son of God:</hi> whenever he is called so upon any other account, it is only in a borrowed and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative sense: the <hi>eternal generation</hi> being the only true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ground of that appellation, whereby he is in a more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical manner called the <hi>son,</hi> and the <hi>only begotten son of God,</hi> by way of eminence, and therefore by way of appropriation, in which neither man, nor Angel, nor any other creature can share with him.</p>
                  <p>In this sense, as we shewed before, our Savior, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, affirmed of him that he was the <hi>son of God;</hi> and for such, they likewise require us, under the greatest obligations ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, to own and acknowledg him. We must believe him so to be the <hi>son of God</hi> as to be <hi>equal to his father,</hi> because <hi>one with him,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62459:143"/> which Christ affirms of himself, <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 30. And tho our Savior in that Chapter justifies the assuming to himself the name of the <hi>son of God</hi> upon the account of his mission and consecration to the high and noble office of a Mediator or Messiah, <hi>ver.</hi> 30 yet it is plain even in that place, that he doth not insist chiefly on that reason, but declares himself to be the <hi>son of God</hi> in a higher and more sublime sense. For after this answer of his to the Jews, which was only <hi>responsum ad hominem;</hi> he justifies his former assertion, viz. <hi>that he and his father were one;</hi> and appeals to his Miracles as the clear proof of what he thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of himself, v. 37. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father,</hi> that is, such as none can do but he that is God, <hi>believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> me not, i. e.</hi> to to be what before I affirmed of my relation to God, that he is my Father. <hi>But if I do, i. e.</hi> the works of my father, then in all reason ye ought <hi>to believe that the Father is in me, and I in him;</hi> or which is the same tho in other words, that <hi>I am one with him,</hi> as I affirmed before.</p>
                  <p>Again, we must believe him <hi>to be the son,</hi> and the <hi>only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten son of God,</hi> who as St. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>was with God in the beginning, and was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made,</hi> Nay the fame St. <hi>John</hi> will tell us, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 10. that if we do not believe him thus to be the <hi>son of God, we make God a Lyar, because we do not believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord which God gave of him,</hi> who by a voice from Heaven, more than once, declared him to be <hi>his beloved Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can be said to avoid the force of such plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press declarations of Christ and his Apostles in this affair? why it is said, even by them who own the eternal generation of our Savior, (for with the <hi>Socinians</hi> I am not now discoursing) that it is a necessary duty to believe him indeed to be the <hi>son of God;</hi> but that it is only necessary to believe him to be so, in one of the <hi>inferior and Metaphorical</hi> significations of that word, but not in the <hi>true and proper,</hi> tho the more noble and sublime.</p>
                  <p>Now this I think at first view to any unprejudiced person may justly seem a strange answer, for in all words which are capable of two senses, the <hi>natural and proper</hi> is the primary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought in the first place, and chiefly to be regarded: and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62459:143"/> the <hi>Figurati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                     </hi> especially if it be subordinate, as it is in the case now before us, is to be considered secondarily, and therefore in a more remote and inferior sense.</p>
                  <p>It will▪ be said, that the Metaphorical and less proper sense, may yet be of greatest importance, as it is in the case before us, it being upon many accounts necessary to believe <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah,</hi> and in that notion the adopted son of God; but it is not of the like consequence to believe him to be the <hi>eternal son of God,</hi> and thereby partaker of the same divine nature with his Father. To which, tho several things might be replyed, yet the answer that I at present insist upon is this, that we cannot rightly and truly own him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> without believing him likewise to be the <hi>son of God;</hi> I mean so, as to be partaker of the divine nature, and therefore <hi>truly and properly God:</hi> forasmuch as no person less than God could discharge the offices, and performe the functions, which were to be executed by the <hi>Messias.</hi> As will appear by a particular consideration of those offices, and the duties and actions which belong to them.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed farther in this matter, I must premise two things. <hi>1st,</hi> That when it is said, as it is on all hands, that it is necessary to believe <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah,</hi> I presume it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon at the same time, that this faith doth not consist on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pronouncing and affirming these words, but chiefly in the acknowledgment of the thing that is intended and signified by them: for without the sense and meaning the words are but a <hi>dead Letter;</hi> and tho we should pronounce them never so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor ever so vehemently; yet if we do not attend to the thing signified thereby, our confession of this truth will signifie no more than the chattering of a Magpie, or the prating of a Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on, which may be taught to pronounce words by rote with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledg of their meaning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That whatever <hi>general faith</hi> in the <hi>Messiah</hi> might be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Jews before <hi>Christ's</hi> coming, or for such who lived presently after it, before these matters relating to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and offices were <hi>plainly and fully revealed;</hi> yet the same will not be sufficient now for such who live within the pale of the Church, and to whom those doctrines are clearly and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62459:144"/> discovered, and sufficiently proposed: of such I say, it is required, that they should not only believe in general that <hi>Jesus is the Messiah:</hi> but, to render that faith effectual to the purposes for which it is enjoined, it is farther required, that they (provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they have capacities to perceive and understand what is thus revealed) should acknowledg and believe, that he did such things as a <hi>Prophet, Priest, and King,</hi> which were necessary for him to perform as a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and man, in order to procure the favor of the one, and the Salvation of the other. And these we say he could not do, if he were not God, as well as man, which I am now to shew.</p>
                  <p>And first, I say he could not be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> nor execute the duty of it, in such a manner, as the Scriptures assure us he did, except he were God. For he was to declare and publish to the world such sublime truths as no created knowledg could possibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, no finite understanding comprehend. And this both with relation to the <hi>nature, perfections,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Math. 11. 27.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>and counsels of God,</hi> which none could possibly find out, but he who was in the <hi>bosome of the Father;</hi> who hath indeed declared and published them to the world, as was formerly shewn.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that he was no otherwise privy to these secrets, than as God the father thought fit to make him so, by a <hi>voluntary discovery</hi> first to him, of what thereby he was empowered to reveal to the world. And to do this, doth not necessarily suppose in him a divine nature; all that may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence is, that by a particular act of <hi>Grace and favor,</hi> he was admitted into a more intimate view of the <hi>nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God</hi> than any other: no such knowledge being ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to any other person, as was freely and graciously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him. <hi>I Ans.</hi> That this was not that in which his superlative dignity above all other Prophets consisted; but he is in the Scriptures plainly distinguished from them, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was enabled to make this discovery, not by an <hi>occasional</hi> and <hi>arbitrary communication;</hi> but by a <hi>permanent, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and abiding</hi> principle of infinite knowledge in himself, and which he no otherwise received from his Father, than as he did the divine nature it self, which was communicated to him,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62459:144"/> by a natural, necessary, and eternal generation. He is closely and intimately united to his father; <hi>he is in the father and the father in him,</hi> whereby they mutually comprehend, and are comprehended of each other. So that he perfectly and at one view beholds the infinite nature and perfections of his father, and is privy to all his counsels and decrees. And as <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man</hi> is conscious to all his own motions, cogitations, and resolutions, without the help of any forreign and new discovery: so the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> knows all the things of God, which none else could know but by the help of that <hi>spirit.</hi> But the <hi>spirit it self</hi> knows them by his own intimate union with God, whose spirit he is, <hi>who searches all things,</hi> even the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 10. Now this <hi>spirit of God,</hi> is likewise the <hi>spirit of Christ,</hi> which was in <hi>the Prophets of old,</hi> and spake by them 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. And it was the same <hi>spirit</hi> which animated and instructed the Apostles, <hi>leading them into all truth,</hi> who, as our Savior saith, should <hi>be given to them by the Father, Jo.</hi> 14. 16. But yet in the succeeding ch. <hi>Jo.</hi> 16. 7. he tells them, <hi>that he would send him</hi> likewise, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Comforter,</hi> who was <hi>the spirit of truth,</hi> who was given them on purpose, <hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> v. 13. of that ch. He was <hi>to receive from Christ</hi> what afterwards he was <hi>to shew unto them,</hi> v. 14. So that he was the <hi>spirit of the Father,</hi> and the <hi>spirit of the Son;</hi> who proceeded from both, and was sent by both; <hi>for all things that the father hath,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>are mine, therefore said I, he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you,</hi> v. 15.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this head: he, who by a <hi>permanent and abiding principle</hi> of knowledge within himself, and not by a <hi>delegated and arbitrary communication,</hi> comprehends within the vast and mighty compass of his understanding the whole divine nature, and all the perfections of his Father, and is privy to all his secrets, as a mans Soul is conscious to all his own thoughts and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he who is the <hi>eternal word and wisdom of his father,</hi> who knows all that the father knows, and hath revealed such things which none could possibly discover but the <hi>eternal spirit,</hi> who lyes in the bosom of God, and thereby <hi>searches the deep things</hi> that are lodged there: He must be endued with infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62459:145"/> and be partaker of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> as well as the <hi>divine secrets,</hi> and therefore must be God. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we ought to submit our reasons, and resign our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings to his authority, it being part of that homage and divine worship which is due to him. And therefore in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith we must be content with his affirmation, whether we do or do not <hi>comprehend</hi> those divine truths which he hath revealed. Which <hi>comprehension</hi> ought to be of no regard in these matters, it being extrinsecal to the true and <hi>formal reason</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; which is not resolved into the <hi>evidence of the thing,</hi> but into the <hi>authority of God,</hi> and the truth and certainty of his Revelations.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Let us consider him as <hi>a King,</hi> and then we shall find that none could execute the <hi>Regal office</hi> in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it was to be administred by the <hi>Messiah</hi> but he that was God. And that first, if we consider the vast extent of his dominion, which was to reach over the whole World; the Heavens and the Earth and all things in them; Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, both good and bad, were to be the Subjects of this mighty Empire. <hi>All things are put under his feet, and he is made the head over all things to the Church,</hi> and for the sake of it, Eph. 1. 22. <hi>He is placed above all principality and power, and might, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but likewise in that which is to come.</hi> v. 21. Upon this account he is styled the <hi>Prince of the Kings of the Earth, King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> Rev. 8. 5. Rev. 27. 14. It is true indeed, this power is said to be given him, as the reward of his obedience and sufferings. But we must know, that antecedent to this gift, he was possessed of a <hi>natural, inherent and essential Soveraignty,</hi> and which he no otherwise received, as was before observed of his infinite knowledg, then as he received the divine nature it self from his father, to which this power is necessarily and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially annexed. And as to that other power which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him as <hi>Mediator,</hi> by way▪ of gift; he could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly have bin capable of it, if he had not been <hi>God</hi> as well as Man. For who can be fit to be entrusted with so vast a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over all parts of the Creation, but he who was the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62459:145"/> Creator of them. None but the eternal God, can be the <hi>Lord of Heaven and Earth:</hi> It is the stile and appellation by which he is known, and by which he is distinguished from all <hi>false Gods.</hi> No Creature is capable of being advanced to so great and high a dignity: because this were to place him upon the same level with the supreme God; which cannot be done, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding all distinction in point of <hi>greatness and power,</hi> between God and the Creature. And the like confusion it must inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bring between both, in the duties of <hi>Homage and adoration,</hi> which are founded in the abovenamed prerogatives of sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and power; quite contrary to the express and solemn declarations of Gods pleasure in this case. For we find him at the same time, and with the same solemnity, asserting the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of his nature, and the <hi>Ʋnity,</hi> if I may so speak, of his worship. Thus Esay 45. 22, 23. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none else.</hi> And <hi>by my self have I sworn, the word is gone forth in righteousness and shall not return:</hi> (the Decree we see is immutable and irreversible) <hi>unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swoar.</hi> These being the acknowledgments of his infinite soveraignty, in which none can share with him, without a high encroachment on his divine prerogative, and a manifest violation of his commands and pleasure: for he hath solemnly and frequently declared, that <hi>this his glory he will not give to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet it is as plain that he hath parted with it to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah: For <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and that every tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11. And accordingly we find <hi>him that sitteth on the Throne,</hi> that is, God the Father, and <hi>the Lamb,</hi> that is, <hi>the Son,</hi> joined together in the same expressions of adoration, and in the highest strains of them, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. we find <hi>the Angels who were about the Throne, and the Beasts and Elders, the number of which was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands:</hi> and together with them, <hi>every Creature which is in Heaven and Earth and under the Earth; and such as are in the Sea and all that are in them, ascribing blessing and glory and power, unto him that sitteth on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:62459:146"/> By which it appears, that they are joined together in the same act of adoration, without any difference or inequality.</p>
                  <p>Now then we must either assert, that the Son of God to whom these <hi>divine honors</hi> are paid, is really partaker of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> as well as these divine honors: or else we must make <hi>Idolatry, viz.</hi> the ascribing divine worship to a creature, an uncertain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary matter; not founded in the eternal and unalterable laws of reason, and the nature of things; but depending upon the positive, and therefore mutable declarations of Gods will and pleasure. And if so, then the <hi>Heathens</hi> were guilty of no such great crime, as hath hitherto been imagined, if of any at all, in giving religious worship, either to <hi>Angels,</hi> or the <hi>souls of pious men;</hi> or other eminent parts of the Creation: forasmuch as God having made no such <hi>plain and positive revelation</hi> of his mind to them in this case, they must upon this supposition, be left to the uncertain conduct of their own <hi>humors and fancys,</hi> or if you please their <hi>Reason:</hi> which yet must be supposed to be left at liberty to make choice of any convenient objects for divine worship; since there were no eternal and unchangable rules of nature, to direct and determine its choice.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> That none could execute the <hi>regal office,</hi> as it was to be administred by the <hi>Messiah,</hi> except he were <hi>God,</hi> will farther appear from a consideration of those actions in which the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of this soveraignty doth consist; as also of those reciprocal duties of hope, trust, dependance, and an entire submission to his authority, which are required of us; all which do necessarily suppose in him <hi>infinite perfections,</hi> and cannot be performed by us, without the supposal of his <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> or at least of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisdome and power:</hi> as is acknowledged by <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Disciples.</p>
                  <p>Now to suppose a <hi>finite being,</hi> capable of these <hi>infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which are requisite for the discharge of this office, is one of the greatest absurdities imaginable, and indeed can amount to no less, than a plain contradiction: because it must quite alter the natures, and take away the distinction of things; and with it all truth and certainty, which must hereby be entirely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and destroyed. And he that can say or affirm this, may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62459:146"/> with equal right affirm or deny any thing at his pleasure, and if he will persist in it, he can neither be convinced nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>

                  <p>I need not here acquaint the Reader what opinion <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Disciples have of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Savior, as it is owned and stated in the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> How they load it, together with the other Articles of the Christian faith which have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with it, with all the heaviest and most scandalous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that wit heightened with malice could possibly suggest. Particularly, that it is a foolish and absurd opinion, repugnant to their clear and distinct Ideas and perceptions; and therefore, that it is so far from being an incomprehensible truth, that they plainly comprehend it to be a contradiction to our natural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it being a brutal and inexcusable error, repugnant to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence as well as true reason.</p>
                  <p>Now let us examin this matter a little, and with the Readers leave and patience, fairly compare the Doctrine of the <hi>Christion Church</hi> concerning the Divinity of our Savior, with what these men affirm of it: and then I doubt not to make it appear; that all that charge of absurdity and nonsense, which (with equal falshood and impudence) they load our doctrine with; is justly to be laid at their door, and retorted upon this <hi>new and monstro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s opinion</hi> of theirs. Which is infinitely derogatory to the honor of God, repugnant to his divine nature and perfections, and tends plainly to undermine the foundations of all Religion, which can never long subsist where the <hi>right notions</hi> of God, and the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction</hi> between him and his creatures are plainly subverted, as they are by this opinion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st</hi> Then: The Christian Church believes and professes that Christ is <hi>true God,</hi> and therefore that he is the <hi>eternal God;</hi> who had his being before the <hi>foundation of the earth and the world was laid, even from everlasting:</hi> necessary existence, and therefore eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> being included in the notion of God. It is true indeed, he hath not his Godhead of and from himself, but from his Father, of whom he was begotten. But however this doth not depend upon arbitrary consent and pleasure, as we before observed, but upon a natural, necessary, and therefore an eternal Generation.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62459:148"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> on the other hand tell us, that he is <hi>a God,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from his Father, and not only so, but that he is a <hi>junior and a modern God;</hi> made and constituted such, the other day, by the appointment of his Father. So that his <hi>Godhead</hi> is purely an arbitrary and contingent matter, not arising from any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity founded in the nature of the thing, but perfectly owing to divine <hi>Grace and favor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let any honest and unprejudiced reader fairly compare both these accounts, and then impartially pass sentence, whether of them seems to be most agreeable to plain reason. Will not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason <note n="1" place="bottom">

Cap. 1.</note>, (I mean where it is not corrupted and depraved) agree with the declaration of the Christian Church, that if Christ be God, he must be so from all eternity? yes undoubtedly it will. Indeed the Christian religion farther informs us, that he hath his Godhead communicated to him by way of Generation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten of the substance of his Father, which because it cannot be either divided or multiplyed, must be one and the very same in both. This we must acknowledge to be a great and deep mystery, not to be <hi>found out,</hi> and much less <hi>fathomed</hi> by our shallow finite understandings. But yet at the same time we must affirm, that tho it <hi>surpasses</hi> our reason, it contains nothing that <hi>overthrows</hi> any plain dictate of it. For tho it must be confessed, that this may be repugnant to common notions and those Ideas which we have of <hi>finite beings,</hi> whose nature and essence cannot be communicated without being multiplyed and divided into parts; but must it from thence follow, that it is contrary to any plain Idea and notion that we have of an <hi>infinite being?</hi> No, neither Logick nor Divinity will teach us to make any such inference; but rather the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that since we cannot forme a <hi>complete and adequate conception</hi> of all the powers and perfections of the Godhead which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; that therefore things <hi>may be so</hi> as the Church declares, for ought that <hi>reason</hi> can shew to the contrary: nay that they <hi>must be so,</hi> since this account is supported by a <hi>supernatural
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62459:149"/> and divine revelation.</hi> It being highly reasonable to conclude, that God allmighty best knows his own nature, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner▪ of its subsistence; and therefore that the account which he gives of himself being certainly true, ought to be believed and entertained, tho we cannot comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Socinian</hi> account of the divinity of Christ, is directly contrary to reason, and overthrows two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal dictates of it, concerning the Unity, and the necessary, and therefore eternal existence of the Godhead; both which are plainly included in the right notion which we frame of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The Church saith, that if Christ be <hi>truly</hi> God, and not only such in a figurative and metaphorical sense: that he must therefore be partaker of the divine nature and substance. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing being what it is by virtue of its nature and essence. If a man be a true man, he must be partaker of a human nature, and a true Angel must partake of the nature of an Angel: And the like must be affirmed of every thing else, whether cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated or uncreated, finite or infinite, the reason being the very same and common to them all. But the <hi>Socinians</hi> on the other hand say that Christ is <hi>truly</hi> God, and yet at the same time that he is a meer man; That he is <note n="1" place="bottom">See the first part of the Preservative, p. 9, 10.</note>

Which is all one, as if a man should assert, that there were a true Triangle which had never an Angle in it, a square with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever a side, a figure without a line, a sentence without words, or a word without ever a letter. None of which can contain a greater absurdity than to say, that there is a true <hi>God</hi> without the <hi>Godhead,</hi> a divine <hi>person</hi> without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>nature.</hi> Which is not only a false assertion, but a plain contradiction, and downright nonsense; If I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this occasion to make use of those decent characters, which these men at every turn bestow upon the sublime Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of our holy faith.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62459:149"/>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> when they affirm Christ to be a <hi>true God</hi> mean that he is so only with respect to his <hi>supreme dominion,</hi> and those divine perfections which are necessary. for the exercise of it. I know they do say so, but by this saying they are so far from clearing the point, that they confirm the former objections, and perplex this matter with new difficulties.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>1st,</hi> They suppose him to be a true God without a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which is nothing else but the divine nature. For tho he should be possessed of the dominion and perfections before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, without the divine nature, if that were possible; yet this would make him a God only in a figurative sense; by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie</hi> of the subject for the adjunct; but he could not be <hi>Deus verus,</hi> which they allways affirm. It is true indeed, this <hi>supreme power</hi> is a clear proof of his <hi>Divinity;</hi> but then it doth not <hi>constitute</hi> but <hi>suppose</hi> him to be God. As the Regal power doth not make the King a man, but suppose him to be such, otherwise he were not capable of it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> By this answer they separate that which is <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> from its <hi>proper subject,</hi> and thereby overthrow one of the first, and most universally received principles of Reason and Philosophy. For this Soveraignty which we are now speaking of, is not in God as it may be in men, founded in compact and voluntary consent; or owing to the appointment of any superior power from whom it may be derived: but it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>divine nature</hi> and perfections, and more immediately in those actions of <hi>Creation and providence,</hi> which necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that divine nature, without which they could not be performed. So that this dominion over his Creatures is a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary</hi> Soveraignty, allways inherent in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and cannot be separated from it. And so are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those before mentioned perfections of <hi>power and wisdom,</hi> which are necessary attributes or <hi>properties</hi> of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So we must be allowed to speak of them in the present case; tho really and truly they are only <hi>different conceptions</hi> of one and the same simple and uncompounded nature.</p>
                  <p>To this it will be farther said, that it is true, these attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62459:150"/> are originally and <hi>essentially</hi> in God; and in Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of <hi>participation,</hi> being communicated to him from God the Father. Be it so, but then we must enquire, whether the divine nature be not likewise communicated with these divine perfections? If they say no it is not; then I say these following absurdities and plain contradictions, must be the unvoidable consequences of that affirmation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> That what is <hi>essential</hi> may be separated from its proper <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: i. e.</hi> the divine perfections from the divine nature: which must entirely destroy all true notions of God, and utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all distinction between him and his creatures: I mean as to his nature and essence. For allowing that these attributes are <hi>originally</hi> in God, and by way of <hi>communication</hi> in his creatures; this will argue only a subordination and dependance, but will be no argument of any difference of nature between them. Now forasmuch as the nature of things in themselves are hid from us, and that we cannot either <hi>know</hi> or <hi>distinguish</hi> them but by their properties and operations: if the <hi>properties</hi> of God can be communicated to men, then the <hi>essential distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man must hereby be confounded and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> From hence it must follow, that what is <hi>peculiar</hi> to one may be common to many, who may <hi>receive</hi> what cannot be <hi>bestowed,</hi> and <hi>participate</hi> of what is <hi>incommunicable.</hi> These things being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the notion of a property; <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> (and such are the divine attributes) that it can neither be separated from the essence, nor communicated to any other. Now that the same thing should be proper and yet common, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and yet be incommunicable, can amount to no less than a palpable contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, From hence it must follow, that a <hi>finite creature</hi> is capable of <hi>infinite perfections:</hi> which is infinitely a greater ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity then to affirm, that not only the writings of <hi>Homer,</hi> but all the water in the Ocean may be comprehended in a nutshel. For supposing for once, that the properties could be <hi>communicated;</hi> yet one would think it were impossible that they should be communicated to a subject that were not <hi>capable</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62459:150"/> of receiving them. That maxim being of undoubted and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth, that <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis.</hi> A rational creature can undoubtedly receive different degrees and improvements of knowledge; but yet this must be still with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to its own powers and capacities. For as no <hi>agent</hi> can do more than he hath <hi>power of doing:</hi> so no <hi>patient</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more then it hath a <hi>capacity of receiving,</hi> which allways supposes a proportion between them. Now there being no proportion between finite and infinite; it must therefore be impossible that a finite being, whose faculties and capacities are finite likewise, should be possessed of infinite power and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, because this were to suppose that it actually enjoyed more than it was capable of receiving.</p>
                  <p>If it should be said that the <hi>capacities</hi> of <hi>Christs</hi> humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were by the Allmighty power of God enlarged, whereby he became in a condition to receive what otherwise he was not naturally capable of. I Ans. That the <hi>capacities</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> could not be enlarged beyond the fixt bounds and limits of his nature, which being finite, can admit of nothing that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. And therefore the question which will arise from hence must be, whether the <hi>nature of Christ</hi> be enlarged as well as these supposed <hi>faculties and capacities.</hi> If they say no, as they do, and are positive in it; then I must affirm that this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is irrational and groundless, and is liable to all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities before mentioned: in making a <hi>finite being,</hi> while it continues such, to have an <hi>infinite capacity:</hi> which is absolutely impossible and more difficult to be conceived; than that the dimensions of a mans hand, while that continues the same as to its substance, should be so far extended, as that within its compass it should be able to grasp not only the globe of the Earth, but likewise the vast and prodigious circumference of the Heavens.</p>
                  <p>In short then, and to bring this matter to some Issue: Are not the <hi>perfections</hi> of infinite power and wisdom proper to God? This cannot well be denyed. <hi>2dly,</hi> Doth not the <hi>supreme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> with which <hi>Christ</hi> is invested, necessarily suppose those infinite perfections, without which it could not be exercised?
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62459:151"/> This likewise must be granted. But will it not therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the last place, that therefore Christ is <hi>God?</hi> Here one would think that <hi>Socinus</hi> should be so entangled that he could not easily disengage himself. But tho you tye him never so fast, and think you have him bound hand and foot; yet by the help of some strange and unforeseen distinction, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently sets himself at liberty.</p>
                  <p>For when urged and pressed with this objection by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Franken</hi> in the dispute between them about the divine worship and adoration of Christ; <hi>Socinus</hi> answers, that Christ indeed is partaker of the divine perfections, and particularly of Omnipotence, but it is only in a certain respect; <hi>viz. in Ecclesia,</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">Ob.

Socin. p. 769.</note> in his Church, and with relation to those things that pertain to it. <hi>Franken</hi> farther urges; that we may not saith he, <hi>brandish our Swords, and combat in the dark:</hi> Is this power of Christ infinite, or is it not? <hi>Socin.</hi> Answers, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, but not absolutely so, but (as he said before) only in his Church. An arbitrary and a very senseless distinction. For he acknowledges that Christ is possessed of a power of doing every thing in the Church, <hi>&amp; ea omnia quae quocunque modo ad Ecclesiam pertinent:</hi> which any way may appertain and be for the good of the Church. And if so, then every thing may come within the compass of this power; because every thing may one way or other, either <hi>mediately or immediately, directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly</hi> have some relation to the Church. For within this Omnipotence is certainly included, as the same <hi>Socinus</hi> confesses,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62459:151"/> the power of <hi>working Miracles,</hi> of <hi>pardoning sins, of raising the dead, of saving and damning;</hi> and in short, of altering the whole course and frame of nature, when it is for the use and service of the Church. All this Christ is allowed to doe, and that by a permanent and abiding principle of action within himself.</p>
                  <p>The same question then naturally returns, and we must ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, is not this power which enables him to do all this, an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power?</hi> Yes saith <hi>Socin.</hi> it is, <hi>in suo genere prorsus divina &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularis,</hi> in its kind absolutely divine, and such as no other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is possessed of. Well? but a power that is thus infinite in one kind, is it not so in every kind? Is it not a contradiction to say, that a person possessed of <hi>omnipotent</hi> power in some cases, is <hi>limited</hi> in others, because hereby he must be limited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, finite and infinite at the same time? No saith <hi>Socin.</hi> it is no absurdity to affirm this of one and the same person, provided it be in different respects, as it is in the case before us. Christs power being as was said before, with respect to his Church infinite; but kept within just limits in respect of other matters which have no relation to it. So that Christ indeed is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> but vet he is <hi>finitely</hi> so; <hi>infinite Omnipotence</hi>
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Loc. jam citato.</hi>
                     </note> being the sole property of God. But is not <hi>infinite omnipotence</hi> a ridiculous tautology, and <hi>finite omnipotence,</hi> a contradictory blunder? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the same omnipotent power which enables Christ to do every thing <hi>within</hi> the Church, enable him likewise to do any thing out of the Church? From whence must this difference arise? It can arise from nothing, but either first from the <hi>difficulty of the things</hi> to be done, or secondly, from the <hi>pleasure and appointment</hi> of God the Father who entrusted him with this power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> As to the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the things, this can be no hinderance to the power of Christ, which is acknowledged to be infinite in its kind, and then certainly it must be so in every kind: because as all things that are placed out of the reach of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and created power are equally hard and difficult; so all things that are possible, to an infinite power are equally easy and capable of being done. It is a ridiculous imagination to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62459:152"/> fansy that any power should <hi>intensively</hi> and with respect to the degrees of power be infinite; and yet <hi>extensively,</hi> and with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the objects, should be limited and finite. Can any thing be too hard for Omnipotence? No certainly, for whereever there is this divine power, it must be <hi>prorsus divina &amp; in omni genere;</hi> it must be so at all times, and in all places, and upon all occasions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Tho it should be allowed that this difference doth not arise from the difficulty of the things to be done, yet it may perhaps be owing to the <hi>pleasure of God;</hi> who hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted our Savior with this mighty power, but under just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions and limitations, <hi>viz.</hi> that he shall exercise it in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Church, but not elsewhere, or upon other occasions.</p>
                  <p>I Ans. That this account, besides that it is liable to those two great absurdities before mentioned, <hi>viz. 1st,</hi> That God (if he so pleased) might bestow an <hi>absolutly infinite power,</hi> in its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent, upon a creature: that is, that he might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate what is incommunicable: for such are the divine attributes, and particularly an <hi>infinite omnipotence</hi> (I use the words of <hi>Socin.</hi> that the Reader may not wonder at the solecisme) which is acknowledged to be such. <hi>2dly,</hi> That a finite being is capable of infinite perfections. And besides these, <hi>3dly,</hi> That one infinite power can be controuled and restrained by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinite power; which is impossible. For tho the persons in whom these powers may be lodged, may be subordinate, yet the powers themselves being infinite must be <hi>equal,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently both being <hi>supreme,</hi> one cannot be <hi>subject</hi> to the other. Otherwise we must suppose the same power to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> and yet <hi>supreme; limited,</hi> and yet <hi>allmighty, Impotent</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent;</hi> which are termes which destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides this I say, it is directly contrary to the express words of Scripture, and even to the interpretation of those Scriptures by <note n="1" place="bottom">

                  <p>The last difficulty with which the <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>factitious divinity</hi> of Christ is chargeable, is, that thereby as they separate the <hi>divine perfections,</hi> so they do <hi>divine worship and adoration</hi> from the divine nature; in direct opposition both to right reason, natural religion, and express revelation.

                  <p>Now if a man were to govern himself by the writings and opinions of these persons, he would find himself reduced to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62459:153"/> inextricable streights. If you do not worship Christ, say the one, <hi>you deny him to be the Messiah,</hi> and thereby turn Apostates from the Christian Religion. But if you do pay divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to him, you do in effect renounce all religion, <hi>and are next door to Atheists.</hi> Now since they are so positive and peremto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this matter, and that the danger of refusing divine honor to Christ on one hand, and that of paying it to him, if he be but a meer creature, is really so great on the other; the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that every one should draw from these different opinions of theirs, is, that the stating and settling the right object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship is a matter of great consequence, in which the honor of God, and the Salvation of mens Souls is nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And therefore that it will behoove us all to enquire not only into the <hi>offices,</hi> but likewise into the <hi>nature</hi> of Christ; which will render <hi>faith in his person,</hi> as we said in the beginning of this discourse to be not only a duty, but a necessary duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot in point either of prudence or safety go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our actions with relation to him. If we are required to pay divine honors to him, the question that will naturally arise from hence, will be, whether he be the right and lawful object of religious adoration? Otherwise we may before we are aware be guilty of Idolatry, which is a crime of so high a nature, that no wise man, would venture upon any action that might carry the least suspicion that way, without mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and clear and full satisfaction about it. Now if he be truly and really God, then it is certain that we may, nay that we must pay him divine honors. But if he be not, then it will be as certain, from the dictates of right reason, and much more so from express and clear revelation, that we ought not to worship him; because we cannot do so, without an open and bold violation of the laws of God, and thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently incurring the guilt of Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>And if any man shall pretend to be satisfied of the contrary, by those shuffling and ambiguous answers of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and those senseless. and arbitrary distinctions which are made use of by him upon this occasion, by which both <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry may in great measure be justified; I say he that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62459:154"/> satisfaction in this affair by these means, against the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and reiterated declarations of God expressed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for my part I cannot think any such person, can have any great concern for the <hi>honor of God,</hi> or the <hi>reputation</hi> of the Christian religion, notwithstanding the pretences which may be made to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>I know it will be here said in behalf of the <hi>English Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians,</hi> that they are not concerned in this charge: because as they acknowledge Christ to be only a man, so they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and declare that divine honors are not due to him. I know they do so, and thereby it is plain that they are more consistent with themselves, and act more agreeably to their principles than <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers. But yet for all this, they are to be told, that their opinions and practices with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Savior are full of <hi>danger</hi> to themselves, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>offensive and scandalous</hi> to all others. There being no sect or party of men this day in the world, besides themselves and their partisans, who own <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah,</hi> who do not likewise make him the object of religious invocation and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: so that hereby they justly come under the same censure which the Apostle passes on the Jews 1 Thes. 2. 15. <hi>that they please not God,</hi> who strictly requires <hi>that all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father,</hi> Jo. 5. 23. <hi>and are contrary to all men,</hi> that is all who profess the name of Christ.</p>
                  <p>It is true inded whilst they are under this perswasion, that Christ is not God, they cannot honestly nor with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science adore and worship him, because it were Idolatry in them so to do.

This may be thought too heavy a censure, but they must thank <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> for it; and therefore if in this, that wise and crafty man, the great promoter of moderation and indifference in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Religion, did not act agreeably to his own principles, (as such designing men seldom do) let them on the other hand, pass what censure they think sit upon him for it. I shall leave them to debate that matter among themselves at their leasure.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have spoken only of two of Christs offices, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Prophetioal and Regal,</hi> and have shewed that they are clear proofs of his Divinity. It remains now in the third place, that we should consider him as a <hi>Priest;</hi> and then we shall find that he could not execute the several parts of his Priestly office ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he were God as well as man. And particularly, that the Sacrifice which he was to offer, and the punishment which he was to undergo for the sins of the world did necessarily require it. For he was to stand <hi>in the room</hi> of sinners, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undergo <hi>the punishment</hi> due to their sins. Which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly underwent, whereby <hi>divine Justice</hi> was so fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and so <hi>perfect a compensation</hi> made for the injury done to the honor and authority of God by the transgression of his Laws; that neither his hatred against sin, nor high displeasure against sinners: neither the sanction of his Laws, nor his vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which might be concerned in the execution of them: saftly, that neither his authority and government, nor his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice which was obliged to take care of it; could now any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be an obstacle to the pardon of sinners: because our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior underwent <hi>that punishment</hi> which the Law threatned, and their sins deserved.</p>
                  <p>When I say that our Savior suffered the punishment due to us; I do not mean strictly <hi>idem,</hi> the same in kind; for <hi>that</hi> he neither did nor could undergo: but <hi>tantundem,</hi> that which was <hi>tantamount,</hi> because of equal value, and therefore every way suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62459:155"/> for the atonement of justice and expiation of sin. Now no creature, no finite being, either Man or Angel, could suffer a punishment that was <hi>equivalent</hi> to the guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of mankind. And therefore if Christ did so, he must be God as well as man. The consequence is unavoidable: We must therefore endeavor to make it out that the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Savior were of this sort, which will be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved from these three following considerations. <hi>1st.</hi> Of the <hi>end and design</hi> of those sufferings. <hi>2dly,</hi> of their own <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick worth and dignity. 3dly,</hi> of the <hi>event and consequence</hi> of them, whereby it will appear that they did not only <hi>equal</hi> but indeed <hi>preponderate</hi> the guilt of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>First, if we consider <hi>the end</hi> of those sufferings, we shall find one of the principal designs of God in them was, that he might declare to the whole world, his implacable detestation of sin and his high displeasure against sinners; and thereby deter men effectually from the practice of it. The former he could not more clearly demonstrate, <hi>viz.</hi> his hatred of sin, than by <hi>punishing</hi> it so severely in the person of his own son: as is evident from those places of Scripture, which mention the sufferings of our Savior, as proceeding from <hi>a judicial act</hi> of God, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his displeasure against sin, and <hi>condemning</hi> it thereby. Hence it is said that <hi>he would not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. Giving the world hereby an amazing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance both of his compassion to men, and of his indignation against sin, that he would not <hi>spare, I say, his own son,</hi> when he appeared in our likeness and with our sins. For <hi>God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> v. 3. of that ch. That is, in those sufferings which Christ sustained in his flesh, or body upon the Cross, God <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sentence</hi> upon sin and <hi>condemned</hi> it, and thereby discovered his justice, and demonstrated his displeasure against it.</p>
                  <p>This indeed, notwithstanding the plain declarations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is denyed by the <hi>Socinians;</hi> but is acknowledged by <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> and his followers, who otherwise in conjunction with the <hi>Socinians</hi> are the violent impugners of the Doctrine of our Savior's <hi>satisfaction:</hi> I mean a true and plenary satisfaction made
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62459:155"/> to the justice of God; which they do not only disown, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor likewise to expose under the contemtible name of the <hi>doctrine</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us consider what God had formerly done in order to shew his hatred of sin, and thereby to discourage and affright men from the commission of it. Not to mention the remarkable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which have overtaken <hi>particular persons,</hi> or those more <hi>publick</hi> testimonies of his displeasure, against <hi>societies and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> by sending among them <hi>fire and sword, famine and pestilence, earthquakes and inundations</hi> whereby states and Kingdoms have been overturned, Cities laid wast, and Countries made deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; I shall only instance in some of those eldest and earliest discoveries of Gods fury and indignation against sinners, which are recorded in Scripture, and designed as a warning to all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> He rained fire and brimstone out of Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>turning the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, he condemned them with an overthrow, who are set forth as an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 6. Jude v. 7. <hi>2dly,</hi> As he destroyed those Cities by fire, so he did the old world by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bringing a <hi>flood upon those ungodly wretches,</hi> and thereby extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the whole race of mankind, except <hi>Noah</hi> and his family who were saved in the Ark. <hi>3dly,</hi> For the transgression of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> he <hi>curst the whole Earth,</hi> and brought <hi>mortality</hi> upon him and all his posterity. For as the violent destruction of the old world, so the natural death of all mankind, is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin, in which we may read Gods high displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. <hi>For by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and thereby judgment came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. 18. Lastly, The numerous company of Apostate Angels, who revolted from their maker, are thereby become the dreadful instances of his implacable vengeance against sin,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62459:156"/> for they <hi>who kept not their first state</hi> of integrity, were forced at the same time to quit their <hi>first habitations:</hi> being tumbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down into those lower regions, where <hi>they are reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude v. 6. All these are clear and unquestionable indications of Gods high displeasure against obstinate sinners▪ And yet we must affirm, that no one of these, nor all of them put together, do in so eminent a manner discover Gods hatred of sin, as doth the punishment of our Savior, when he stood in the place, and suffered in the room of sinners.</p>
                  <p>That God should overthrow the Cities of the plain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the old world, turn <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, and both him and all his posterity afterwards out of the world. That he would not spare those once glorious spirits, who kept not their first estate, are remarkable instances, as we said before, of his justice. Yet that God should <note n="1" place="bottom">

For who can be so foolish as to entertain any thoughts of escaping punishment, since it overtook the <hi>son of God</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>In short, nothing can so effectually encrease mens horror against sin, and deter them from the practice of it, as the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of those sufferings which our Savior underwent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account, and for the expiation of it. In them we have the greatest instance of <hi>Gods indignation,</hi> and not only so, but of his <hi>wisdom</hi> likewise, that ever was discovered to the world. Other examples of Gods justice tho very dreadful, yet were such as did not exceed a finite invention: but this was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the contrivance of Heaven, at which both men and Angels justly stand astonished. They pry and search into this mystery, but the farther they search, the more they admire, and return
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62459:156"/> from this enquiry only with wonder and amazement. Here we have the <hi>liveliest Ideas</hi> of the guilt of sin, and of Gods displeasure against it; for after all former, and beyond all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture examples of divine vengeance, the justice of God is most conspicuous in the <hi>death of his son.</hi> And therefore his death, must not only <hi>equal,</hi> but <hi>outdoe</hi> the death and sufferings of all mankind; yea and of all the Apostate Angels into the bargain. Here then I think we may set our foot, and rest as upon sure ground, and therefore may safely and warrantably pronounce, <hi>that God could not do more to testify his displeasure against sin, and to discountenance the practice of it, than to make his only son an offering for sin, and to give him up to those sorrows and sufferings which he underwent for our sins, and for our sakes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereby God hath taken the most effectual care, for to secure his Authority and Government in the world; and to discourage and affright men from the violation of his laws. But this end of Christs sufferings looks only <hi>forwards,</hi> but we must likewise look <hi>backwards,</hi> and consider God as one <hi>highly incensed,</hi> and his <hi>justice provoked</hi> by the sins of men. And therefore before he will be reconciled to them, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably imagine, that some way was to be found out, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease his wrath, and pacify his indignation; and this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother end of Christs sufferings, <hi>viz. 2dly,</hi> to <hi>satisfy the justice of God,</hi> which he did by standing in the place of sinners, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the malediction of the Law, and suffering the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the law threatned, and their sins deserved.</p>
                  <p>For the proof and confirmation of this, I must be forced in some measure to repeat what hath formerly <note n="1" place="bottom">Preservative part 2d. p. 112. &amp;c.</note> been delivered upon this occasion. And <hi>1st,</hi> I must affirme what I think hath formerly been sufficiently proved, that the sufferings of our Savior were <hi>properly a punishment.</hi> This we must insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as upon a matter of great importance, without which we cannot rightly apprehend the nature and design of Christs death, and without which he could not perform the errand upon which he came into the world. For the great end of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62459:157"/> his coming, and taking our nature upon him was, that he might <hi>dye for sinners,</hi> and lay down his life in <hi>the room,</hi> and <hi>in exchange</hi> for theirs. This is denyed not only by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but likewise by the <note n="1" place="bottom">Vid. Limb. Th. Christ. Lib. 3. Cap. 22.

                     <hi>proper Sacrifice,</hi> that his life was <hi>the price</hi> of our redemption, which was paid down for us, that we thereby might be freed from the guilt of fin, and the obligation to suffering: That he was made <hi>a curse</hi> by undergoing an accursed death for us: which clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates a permutation and exchange of persons: we sinned and deserved punishment, and he underwent that death which we had deserved. None of which can be true, if the death and sufferings of Christ were not properly a <hi>punishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> the guilt of tho criminal was transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Sacrifices, which thereby became accursed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to destruction. If Christ stood in our roome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the sentence of the Law; then he must undergo <hi>a punishment;</hi> because what the law threatens must be a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwise we can have no notion of it.

I am ashamed to use so many words in so plain a case.</p>
                  <p>And yet for all this, Christ must not be said to be punished for us, but to undergo that which was <hi>vice poenae,</hi> instead of punishment. If so, then Christ was not truly a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but he was <hi>vice sacrificii,</hi> he served in the room of one; and was not substituted properly <hi>loco nostro</hi> in our place, (as hitherto we have been taught) but <hi>loco sacrificii,</hi> in the place and instead of a Sacrifice.

Cap. 23. Sect. 18.</note> hatred of sin, and his indignation against sinners, as was said before. But how could this be discovered I beseech you, if those suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were only <hi>afflictions and calamities,</hi> which if considered in themselves, barely as such, are so far from being arguments of Gods <hi>indignation,</hi> that on the other hand they <hi>may be,</hi> nay indeed in that case allways <hi>are</hi> consistent with his <hi>greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to those persons who are thus rendred calamitous? But on the other hand in <hi>punishment,</hi> the anger of God is very clearly manifested, which thereby becomes a very proper means to discourage men from sinning. The Law that prescribes men their duty, threatens the violation of it with punishment; and when this sentence is executed upon Malefactors, then every man in such execution may read his own doom, which if any thing can, will deterre them from the like practises.</p>
                  <p>But if we see an innocent person afflicted and rendered mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; forasmuch as this doth not suppose the transgression of any Law, as the cause of such misery, it can be no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gods displeasure;</hi> nor consequently any restraint upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62459:158"/> men, to hinder or deterre them from sinning. Nay on the other hand, this is so far from deterring men, that to wicked minds it often becomes an occasion, and proves an encouragement to sin.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that these sufferings which Christ underwent, tho they were only afflictions, yet were inflicted on him upon <hi>the account,</hi> and for <hi>the sake</hi> of our sins, which were the meritorious cause of them. For we sinned, and he became miserable in our room. Be it so, but then we must ask, are not calamities, and especially death, when sent <hi>for the sake</hi> and upon <hi>the account</hi> of sin, properly punishments? If not, then we have lost the true signification of words; and those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are of that opinion, must contrive to alter our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, before we can consent to make this alteration in our Religion.</p>
                  <p>By all this it plainly appears that the sufferings of Christ were <hi>properly a punishment.</hi> And if so, it must as plainly follow in the second place, that these sufferings proceeded from the <hi>justice of God,</hi> and were designed to give satisfaction to it. There being a necessary and an essential relation between these two, <hi>viz. punishment</hi> and <hi>justice.</hi> This latter being the next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate principle and faculty, if I may so say, from whence the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer proceeds. For it is not <hi>wisdome,</hi> or <hi>righteousness,</hi> as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks Gods holyness and the rectitude of his nature; nor yet <hi>bare power</hi> considered in it self, to which punishments are to be ascribed. For tho all these may be concerned and are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the punishment of sinners; yet they are not the next and formal principle to which they are to be attributed. For if they were, then every person endued with wisdome, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or might and strength, might be supposed empowered to punish a malefactor, which yet we know they are not.</p>
                  <p>For the better understanding of this matter, we may consider sin under a double respect. <hi>Ist,</hi> As being opposite to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate <hi>purity and holyness</hi> of God. <hi>2dly,</hi> As being contrary to his <hi>Laws,</hi> of which sin is the violation or transgression. The first is an opposition to the <hi>nature,</hi> and the second to the <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of God. In both cases sin is an <hi>impurity,</hi> and therefore we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62459:159"/> may consider the sinner under a double defilement thereby. The first is properly called the <hi>filth and pollution</hi> of his nature, which is really deformed and stained by sin. The second is <hi>guilt,</hi> or an obligation to punishment. Now if we could imagine that God could send a creature endued with reason into the world, and not prescribe him Laws for the government of his actions, but leave him at liberty to act as he pleased: yet in this case, we must suppose that his reason would, tho not <hi>command,</hi> yet <hi>direct him</hi> to act suitably to the dignity and constitution of his nature.</p>
                  <p>For there are certain decencies which arise from the natures of rational creatures and their relation to each other. And if a man should act contrary to those dictates of his nature, he would contract a defilement thereby, <hi>viz.</hi> from that <hi>natural and essential turpitude</hi> which would be in those immoral actions; as being directly contrary to the rectitude and purity of Gods nature, which is the grand <hi>rule and standard</hi> by which his own actions are governed; and therefore must much more be a <hi>rule</hi> for the actions of all other rational creatures. And the <hi>turpitude</hi> of such actions would render the persons committing them odious and detestable in the sight of God; who by virtue of that <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power</hi> which he hath over his Creatures, might shew his abhorrence of them by suitable actions, as we would our abhorrence of Toads and Serpents. That is, he might tread them under his feet, crush them to pieces, or spurn them out of his presence, as we would the most venemous or loathsome Creatures. And there is nothing in all this but what is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that universal and essential justice in God, whereby he not only hates all vice and immorality, but likewise at the same time, and for the same reason detests the persons who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it. But yet all this would only be an instance of his <hi>abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> which would be justifyed by that <hi>absolute dominion</hi> which he hath over his Creatures. And as such a defilement in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case could not properly be called <hi>guilt;</hi> so neither would those actions of displeasure properly be styled <hi>punishment:</hi> which allways hath relation to the violation of a Law.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>2dly,</hi> we must consider all rational Creatures
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62459:159"/> as under the <hi>obligation of a Law,</hi> whereby their duty is prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them under certain penalties, which are threatned to all such as shall transgress it. For tho in point of speculation we may, and must sometimes distinguish between Gods <hi>universal righteousness,</hi> and his <hi>Jurisdiction;</hi> yet in fact they can never be separated: because this <hi>righteousness</hi> with relation to rational creatures, will allways and necessarily be joined with <hi>authority and legislation.</hi> It would be an infinite derogation to the wisdom and righteousness of God, to suppose, that he could leave rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creatures without laws for the Government of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: because this were to suppose a <hi>God</hi> without a <hi>providence,</hi> which were the next door to <hi>Atheism,</hi> and that thro which it must inevitably enter into the world <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>See the preservative 1st. part. p. 34. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>And as all rational creatures must necessarily be under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and obligation of Laws, so those laws must be enforced by <hi>certain sanctions,</hi> otherwise they would loose their nature, and be no other nor better than wholsome counsel and good advice. And lastly, as the laws must be enforced by threatnings, so we must suppose something in every legislator, that <hi>moves and inclines him</hi> to execute those threatnings upon such as shall transgress his Laws. And this is as necessary as the former: because, as the laws would be ineffectual without <hi>sanctions,</hi> so those sanctions would be equally insignificant, without such an <hi>inclination</hi> in the legislator to put them in execution. The execution it self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be stopped for some very weighty reasons. But the <hi>general disposition</hi> and inclination to execute them must be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; otherwise, let the threatnings be never so severe, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations to punish uttered in never such high and peremptory expressions, no man would be under the terror of them, so as to be affrighted thereby from sinning. And these are things that are to be found in all <hi>Laws,</hi> and all <hi>Lawgivers,</hi> whether <hi>Humane</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> the reason being the very same and common to them all.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>attribute</hi> whether in God or Men, that is concerned in the execution of threatnings, is not, as I said before, <hi>power</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62459:160"/> or <hi>wisdome</hi> or <hi>universal righteousness,</hi> (which in men is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name <note n="1" place="bottom">

And this justice as it constitutes a particular <hi>virtue</hi> in men, so for the same reason, it must be considered by us as a distinct <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> in God.</p>
                  <p>For the farther confirming and clearing of this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I shall endeavor to make good these following particulars. <hi>1st,</hi> That there is such a thing as <hi>punitive justice</hi> in God. <hi>2dly,</hi> That the punishments which he inflicts procede from that justice, and among other ends, are designed for the discovery and satisfaction of it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> That there is such a thing in God as <hi>punitive Justice;</hi> I mean as distinct from that <hi>universal justice</hi> or righteousness of his nature, of which the former is a part. For general justice as <hi>Grotius</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">Lib. de Satisf. Cap. 1. p. 33.</note> rightly observes, as it is conversant about different objects, hath different effects, and therefore hath dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent names. As it is conversant about the moral actions of rational agents, it discovers it selfe in <hi>retribution,</hi> and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it with relation to evil actions are <hi>punishments.</hi> And therefore as this justice in men, is defined by the ancients <note n="3" place="bottom">Hierax. apud Stobaeum de Just.

                     </gap>, that which requires and demands punishment; so this Justice of God, as is rightly observed by <hi>Grotius</hi>

                  <p>When we say God is thereby <hi>moved or enclined</hi> to punish, we must not fancy any such <hi>transient motions or inclinations</hi> in him, as are to be found in men, which are taken up and laid down
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62459:160"/> upon occasion. Such indeed are very foolishly and impiously ascribed to God by the <hi>Socinians;</hi> I say impiously, because they are inconsistent with his divine wisdome and perfections. But by that phrase we mean the <hi>anger and displeasure</hi> of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sinners, arising from a just and great provocation, which will certainly end in their punishment, except for some weighty reason he shall think fit to suspend it, by which his glory may be more illustrated than in the punishment. And this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> in God is <hi>natural,</hi> arising from his implacable hatred of sin, and is necessarily supposed in the threatnings annexed to his Laws, without which those threatnings, as we before observed, would be insignificant.</p>
                  <p>Upon which account the light of nature, antecedent to any positive declaration of his purpose, directed men to apprehend this in God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was highly displeased with them for their sins, and would certainly be revenged upon them, except they could find out some way to appease his anger, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his indignation. Indeed if we speak strictly, God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>angry</hi> nor <hi>appeased,</hi> neither <hi>provoked</hi> nor <hi>pacifyed;</hi> his infinite perfections placing him out of the reach of such mean passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are to be found in men. But when we speak of God we must do it in such a way as is agreeable to our own shallow and imperfect conceptions of his nature (provided that we do not thereby derogate any thing from his perfections) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we must neither think nor speak of him at all. And therefore, in the same sense that we say that God is <hi>angry or provoked,</hi> we must say that God is <hi>moved</hi> to do that which mens sins provoke him to do, (that is to punish them) and which he certainly will do if some great reason doth not interpose, and prevent the punishment. The <hi>inclination to punish sin,</hi> we see, in God is natural, and therefore <hi>punitive justice,</hi> from whence that inclination proceeds, must be so too.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>universal righteousness,</hi> and this <hi>particular justice</hi> which is called punitive, in God are really one and the same thing. But so are all his other <hi>Attributes</hi> likewise, which are neither distinguished from his nature, nor from each other, by any real distinction. But forasmuch as we cannot fully and at one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62459:161"/> view comprehend his infinite nature and perfections, we must form different conceptions of them in our own minds, and <hi>distinguish.</hi> those things there, which are all <hi>united</hi> in God. And thus by his own warrant, (who is pleased in the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of himself in Scripture, to condescend to our imperfect conceptions) we are taught to distinguish his <hi>nature</hi> from his <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,</hi> and his <hi>Attributes</hi> from each other: which are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished sometimes, (as they are in the case before us,) by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent objects, and those different operations which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋniversal justice,</hi> is an absolute Attribute in God, and may be considered in him abstracting from all other considerations of Government, and Laws, and threatnings. But <hi>punitive justice</hi> is a relative Attribute, and supposes God standing in relation to rational creatures, as they are subject to his Authority, and under the direction of his Laws. <hi>Ʋniversal righteousness</hi> is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the whole creation, and in every thing in a manner, that God doth in it. Every <hi>action of his power,</hi> every <hi>decree of his will,</hi> every external <hi>demonstration of his counsel and purpose</hi> is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and conducted by it. But <hi>punitive justice</hi> hath for its object sinful Creatures, and is conversant about punishments only.</p>
                  <p>And as we may warrantably say in general, that God is by the instinct of his own nature, <hi>enclined</hi> to do every thing that is necessary for promoting of his own glory: so in particular, that he is <hi>disposed</hi> to do that, which tends plainly to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his great hatred of sin, the support of his Authority, and the vindication of his providence, all which are seen in the punishment of sinners. We may call this if we please, <hi>universal justice,</hi> but then by confounding these <hi>principles,</hi> we cannot avoid running into a confusion in discoursing of such <hi>actions</hi> which flow from them, which ought carefully to be distinguished. And without which distinction, we cannot (as I conceive, with submission to better judgments) rightly either state the truth, or vindicate it against the cavils of our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. For <hi>Socinus</hi> acknowledges that there is such a thing in God as <hi>universal righteousness,</hi> and that it is very agreeable to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62459:161"/> this righteousness, that <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Interim haudquaquam negamus, Dei justitiam ac rectitudinem, ut in caeteris omnibus ipsius operibus, ita etiam in poenis cerni, earumquè modum gubernare deinde nec illud negamus, rectitudinem ac justitiam Dei nonnunquam eum ad peccata puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda movere: eorum nempe, quibus veniam non concedere non modo aequitati per se est admodum consentaneum, verum etiam decretis divinis, ut ita loquar, debitum; quales sunt homines non resipiscentes atque in peccatis contumaciter perseverantes, quemadmodum</hi> Socinus <hi>ipse eo loco, quem</hi> Grotius <hi>notavit,</hi> (Lib. scil. 1. de Christo Serv. &amp; Cap. 1.) <hi>docuerat.</hi> Crell.

But yet so, that this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not proceed <hi>from the justice, and displeasure of God,</hi> but from <hi>his will,</hi> and is only the result of an arbitrary, and mutable Decree. But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly</hi> as there is such a thing as <hi>punitive Justice</hi> in God, so the <hi>punishments</hi> which he inflicts upon sinners, flow from it; and are among other ends designed for the discovery and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of it. And in certain punishments no other end but this is intended and aimed at. Indeed in humane punishments the preservation of Government, and the benefit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which is thereby maintained and supported, is <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,</hi> and in most cases <hi>only</hi> aimed at. And this is the great rule and standard by which they are to be regulated: So that to equal sins, unequal punishments; and equal punishments, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal sins may be assigned, if the publick good so require. Nay not only the <hi>distribution,</hi> but the <hi>suspension</hi> likewise of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments is to be regulated hereby. So that the most flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious criminals, at least if the Law of God doth not otherwise interpose, may be suffered to escape unpunished, if their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be adjudged inconsistent with the <hi>publick safety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in these punishments, as we before intimated, Magistrates and Governors principally aim at the security of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore do not inflict them so much for <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> of what is past, (except it be in case of <hi>injury and damage,</hi> strictly so called, which either the publick or private persons sustain thereby, in which cases, common reason and equity will allow a recompense to be made to the injured party) as to prevent the like crimes for the future. But in divine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62459:162"/> nothing is so much to be considered as the violation of the divine authority; nor any thing so much aimed at by God, as the <hi>satisfaction of his justice,</hi> and a <hi>compensation</hi> to be made it, for the wrongs and injuries which he sustains, by the transgression of his Laws.</p>
                  <p>It is true such punishments in this world do likewise <hi>look forward,</hi> and are designed to deter others from the like viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law; and very often are joined with a merciful intention to the sinner himself, in order to bring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life. But besides these, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in some punishments God principally aims at the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Authority, and a compensation to his justice for what is past; and is not moved to punish by the consideration of any thing, <hi>extra Deum,</hi> without himself, but <hi>ideo punit, us puniat;</hi> that is, that thereby he may manifest his hatred of sin, and indignation against sinners, and execute his vengeance upon his enemies.

                     <hi>Grotius</hi> hath rightly stated this matter, with whom agrees <note n="2" place="bottom">

                  </p>
                  <p>And without allowing this, we cannot give any satisfactory account either of the punishments of the <hi>fallen Angels,</hi> or of those which overtake incorrigible sinners, sometimes <hi>in this life,</hi> but especially of those which will be inflicted on them <hi>in the next.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First as to the <hi>Apostate Angels,</hi> we know that upon their Apostacy and revolt from their maker, they were by an <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable sentence</hi> doomed to eternal misery, without hopes of pardon, or possibility of escape. Now what ends, I beseech yee, can we assign of this <hi>terrible sentence?</hi> was it joined with any <hi>merciful intentions</hi> to them, in order to move them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and thereby render them capable of pardon. No,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62459:162"/> here was no mixture of compassion, no place left for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, no room for mercy, no intentions in God to pardon, no inclinations in them to desire or procure it. They are doomed to eternal obduration as well as torment. No spark of goodness being left, but all dispositions to it being totally and eternally exstinguished.</p>
                  <p>Well, but tho these punishments can work no good upon themselves, were they not designed as <hi>examples</hi> thereby to deterre others? no they were not. Not to deterre men; for tho now their punishment is proposed. in Scripture as a good means to affright men from disobedience, yet forasmuch as both their <hi>sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> was antecedent to the <hi>Creation of man,</hi> that could not be any reason or design of their misery and torments. Nor are they proposed as <hi>examples</hi> to the good Angels, who kept their <hi>first estate,</hi> and with it are immutably fixed in their <hi>first habitations,</hi> and the happyness which they enjoy in them. As a reward of their obedience, they were immediatly confirmed in their integrity, and are placed out of the reach of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and possibility of sinning. Some indeed have thought otherwise, but their opinion in this matter, hath been censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned by the generality of Divines both anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern.</p>
                  <p>Either then we must say that their punishment is unjust, as being without any <hi>good reason</hi> to warrant it: or else we must allow that it was inflicted on them for the <hi>discovery of Gods justice,</hi> and the satisfaction of it; no other can be tolerably assigned or imagined but this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The secret and <hi>invisible punishments</hi> of some obstinate sinners in this life, who by the righteous judgment of God, are delivered up to final obduration and impenitence, are a a farther proof of our assertion. For they are not hereby made <hi>examples</hi> to deterre others, because this cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, but by <hi>visible</hi> at least, if not publick inflictions. Whereas in this case, that final obduration to which they are doomed, is not discernible by any humane eye, but is known only to God himself.</p>
                  <p>Lastly as such invisible punishments in this life, so the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62459:163"/> punishment</hi> of incorrigible sinners in the next, will be an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable proof and demonstration of this matter: which will not be inflicted on them to prevent the violations of the Law for the future, but by way of compensation for what is past. <hi>Here</hi> indeed, in this life, in punishing God aims at the <hi>support</hi> of his Authority and Government; but there, in the next, he designs only to <hi>revenge</hi> the contempt of it. That is, as <hi>Grotius</hi> before expressed it, <hi>ideo punit ut puniat;</hi> he punishes for the sake of punishment. Not as that punishment is subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to any external ends of Government, but only that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may display the glories of his <hi>holyness and power,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of his <hi>justice,</hi> which then will most eminently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in the eternal miseries of the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Neither are the <hi>ends and reasons</hi> of those future punishments, to be taken, from the <hi>threatnings and monitions</hi> which are given men in this life. For tho this will be one greater aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their guilt and misery than that of the <hi>Apostate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, viz.</hi> that they brought all this mischief upon themselves, by going on in a course of sinning, notwithstanding so many warnings, and the hopes of pardon joined to them, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their repentance and return; yet, tho hereby they will be found infinitely to have <hi>deserved</hi> punishment, we must farther enquire for <hi>what reasons</hi> God will inflict it. For if no <hi>good end</hi> can be served by it, to be sure, notwithstanding their deserts, God will not in the conclusion impose that punishment. It is true God hath annexed threatnings to his Laws, and the end of those threats is to prevent the violation of them. But since the Law is violated, and the transgressors therefore to be punished, we must now enquire after the <hi>end of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi> as well as the <hi>reason of the sanction.</hi> For except not only a just, but some great end were to be served by these punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be sure, as we intimated before, the God of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, would never execute them in so terrible a manner upon his Creatures, as we are assured he will.</p>
                  <p>Now what ends I beseech you, can we assign of them <hi>extra Deum,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> rightly states this matter. They cannot be designed for the <hi>security of his Government,</hi> or the <hi>reformation of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62459:163"/> the parties suffering,</hi> as was said before. Those reasons will then be at an end. We must therefore find a reason taken from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in God himself. And this must be chiefly and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally his <hi>Punitive Justice,</hi> which will be then made illustrious, and he thereby be honored in the condemnation and execution of his enemies. Perhaps it may be said, that this will be done to to discover and vindicate his <hi>veracity,</hi> he having often and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emtorily declared that he would thus punish all obstinate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledged indeed, that his <hi>truth</hi> is concerned in the execution of his threatnings. But this cannot be the <hi>principal end,</hi> nor strictly speaking any <hi>end</hi> at all. For tho God who hath annexed threatnings to his Laws, hath likewise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a declaration to those threatnings, of <hi>his immutable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> to put them in execution: yet the reason of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self is not barely to verify his word; for we cannot think that the merciful Creator of the world would make his creatures eternally miserable only, or chiefly because he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he will do so: But he hath signifyed his <hi>irrevocable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> of so doing; because his own glory, and particularly that of his justice will thereby be rendered illustrious to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ages.</p>
                  <p>And in this is the remarkable difference between humane and divine vengeance, as we have intimated before; which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not be conducted, as we find it oftentimes is in men, by any <hi>furious and ungovernable passions;</hi> or proceed from <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and rash resentments</hi> of real or pretended injuries: but from fixt and immovable resolutions in God to manifest and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his own glory, which will be rendered illustrious in the condemnation of the wicked, as well as the rewards of the righteous. In the former God himself will take delight and pleasure; as well as in the latter: not because it is the misery of his <hi>Creatures as such,</hi> (far be it from us from entertaining any such thoughts as that of the merciful Creator, and righteous Judge of the world) but of <hi>guilty and incorrigible creatures,</hi> who would go on in an obstinate course of sinning without remorse, and against all monitions to the contrary. The justice of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62459:164"/> which proceeding, will be acknowledged by the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who are to suffer, and accompanied not only with the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> but the <hi>applauses</hi> and <hi>acclamations</hi> likewise of Saints and Angels. For the time will come when the meek and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Savior of mankind will ascend his Tribunal, before whom all Nations shall be assembled, and then he, whose bowels so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten yearned over these sinners, will with a stern countenance and inflexible rigor pass sentence upon them. In which all the Saints, who shall then sit as <hi>Assessors</hi> with him on his Throne, shall join with him, together with his holy Angels, in whose sight as we said before, and with whose approbation all this shall be transacted.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is a <hi>sad,</hi> but a very <hi>great truth;</hi> and this we must insist upon as a matter of great importance, without which we cannot give a satisfactory account of the justice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Gods dealing with sinners at the great day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, hereby we shall lay the most effectual restraint upon wicked men, and affright them from going on in an evil course; because if they do so, they hereby find that they must inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably and eternally be miserable, without <hi>hopes of mercy</hi> or <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of escape.</hi> For as the <hi>certainty</hi> of the sinners punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth appear from the threatning, which is peremtorily denounced by God, with an express declaration of his irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable purpose to execute it: so the <hi>righteousness</hi> of it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the consideration that <hi>Gods glory</hi> will be thereby manifested: the glory (as I said before) of his <hi>holyness, power,</hi> and particularly of <hi>his justice</hi> which will then take place, (the day of mercy, together with all hopes of it being now utterly ended) and will then be displayed in the eternal <hi>perdition,</hi> join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the eternal <hi>confusion</hi> of all his enemies.</p>
                  <p>To proceed: in the third place we are to shew that the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Savior did fully and perfectly satisfy the justice of God. The sufferings of Christ being a <hi>punishment,</hi> must as hath been allready shewn, have relation to the <hi>justice of God,</hi> which did inflict it, and was plainly manifested and discovered by it. And that hereby a <hi>full and plenary satisfaction</hi> was made to that Justice, appears from the effect and consequence of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62459:164"/> his sufferings, <hi>viz.</hi> that God who before was angry with sinners, is now pacifyed and appeased. He is willing to enter into a Covenant of grace and mercy, whereby he engages himself to admit them into favor, and to be reconciled to them: provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they will perform such easy conditions as he shall require on their parts, <hi>viz. faith the repentance,</hi> which are no other than such as are absolutely necessary to qualify them for his favor. So that there is now nothing further required on <hi>Gods part,</hi> to move and dispose him to pardon sinners. All the obstacle of reconciliation is on <hi>mans side.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law threatened 'tis true, and men by sinning deserved punishment; but Christ stood in their roome, and underwent what otherwise must have fallen upon their Heads. So that now a <hi>sufficient compensation</hi> being made to the honor of God, for those injuries which he sustained by the violation of his Laws; his justice doth now no longer interpose, to demand their punishment or hinder their pardon.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, it is true indeed Gods justice is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>satisfied,</hi> but this <hi>satisfaction</hi> doth not arise from the <hi>suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ,</hi> considered in themselves, but from <hi>divine grace and acceptation.</hi> To which I answer, that the <hi>divine acceptance</hi> in this case is absolutely requisite, without which the death of Christ, tho it were of much greater value than it really is (if that were possible) could have no influence upon the pardon of sin: because God the Father who is considered as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal party injured, might have demanded the lives of the criminals themselves, and have refused <hi>any commutation</hi> tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so valuable. But supposing that God was willing so far to relax his Laws, as to accept of <hi>an exchange</hi> (as he did in this case) whereby his honor might be vindicated and his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice satisfied; I say the satisfaction thus made, doth depend upon the <hi>worth and value</hi> of the punishment it self which our Savior underwent in our stead, which <hi>sua vi &amp; efficacia,</hi> by its own force and efficacy did expiate the sins of the world.</p>
                  <p>And wherein I pray you did its efficacy consist, but in this, that his life which he laid down was of <hi>equal value</hi> to the lives of all men which were forfeited to justice; and his death
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62459:165"/> consequently <hi>equivalent</hi> to their death; because hereby Gods hatred of sin and his indignation against sinners was as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous as if all mankind had suffered and dyed? The <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> indeed deny that God was angry with sinners: but the <hi>Rem.</hi> who are in part adversaries to this truth, do plainly own it: and do farther acknowledge, that Christ by the sacrifice of himself, did pacify and appease the wrath of his Father, <hi>ex irato placatum reddere.</hi> But how is he appeased? Is it only because he was pleased to lay aside his resentments, and did graciously accept of a <hi>small punishment</hi> instead of a <hi>much greater</hi> which we deserved? This indeed may be an argument of his <hi>liberality,</hi> and may magnify <hi>his grace;</hi> but is a great diminution to the worth and dignity of our <hi>Savior</hi>'s <hi>sufferings,</hi> which appear in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward virtue and efficacy, and to which the Scriptures do very plainly and emphatically ascribe the expiation of sin.</p>

                     </gap>, it was <hi>impossible that the blood of Bulls and Goats could take away sin.</hi> How impossible? if the virtue of all sacrifices did depend upon <hi>divine acceptation,</hi> was it not possible that God might have appointed, and have accepted of the life of a Beast instead of that of the greatest Malefactor in any case, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might be freed not only from a temporal, but likewise from the obligation to an eternal death; I mean <hi>accedente fide &amp; poenitentia,</hi> upon condition of faith and repentance, without which the sacrifice of Christ himself will not be effectual to procure actual pardon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Remonstr.</hi> I am sure will teach us another lesson, <hi>viz.</hi> that God if he pleased might <seg rend="sup">5</seg> have pardoned the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62459:165"/> inward guilt, as well as the outward pollution, by any sacrifices, or by any other means and conditions such as he should freely and graciously appoint. Wherein then lies the difference in point of expiation, between the <hi>sacrifices of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>oblation of Christ;</hi> that one could <hi>purge the Conscience</hi> and <hi>take away sin,</hi> but the other could not? If all be resolved into divine appointment and pleasure; then I say it might equally be affirmed of the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> (if considered in it self) as well as of that of <hi>Calves and Goats,</hi> that it could not <hi>take away sin,</hi> that it could not <hi>make the comers to God perfect as pertaining to the Conscience:</hi> nay that it was impossible it should do so. And on the other hand, upon the same supposition, it might be affirmed of the legal Sacrifices as well as of that of the Gospel, <hi>viz.</hi> if God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to that purpose (as they say he might) that <hi>they did obtain eternal redemption for us,</hi> that they did <hi>take away sin,</hi> that they did <hi>sanctify, not only to the purifying of the flesh,</hi> but likewise <hi>to the purging of the Conscience from dead works;</hi> and lastly that they <hi>perfected for ever them that were sanctified and cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> thereby. And therefore that they needed not be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated year by year, <hi>because the worshippers being thus once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged, would have no more Conscience of sin.</hi> These are things that would sound very oddly to any Christian ear. But yet these must be the unavoidable consequences of that opinion, which makes the efficacy of Christs death like that of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the law, to depend upon divine approbation and consent, for by this account they are put upon the same level as it were.</p>
                  <p>You will say, there is a vast difference still between them, which arises from the dignity and worth of <hi>the person</hi> of our Savior. As to what concerns the person of our Savior, the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> we know, do account him to be but a meer man as to his

                  <p>The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> indeed do say that he is <hi>the son of God,</hi> and <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> (Tho I am afraid <note n="2" place="bottom">

Where he asserts not only a subordination between the Father and the Son, which we likewise grant; but that the Son is inferior to his Father, and the Father consequently superior to the Son: <hi>aevo, potentia, dignitate,</hi> This he saith was the opinion of the Fathers of the first three Centuries; for proof of which he cites the Testimony and Confession of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Petavius</hi> which he mentions with approbation; who among other things tells us, that the aforesaid Fathers did believe the Son of God, <hi>non minus quam caeteras cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas initium habuisse; hoc est, minime ex aeterno distinctam hypostasin habuisse, puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
                     </note> they call him so only in the <hi>Arian</hi> sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is a divine person, but inferior to his Father, both in <hi>duration, power, and dignity,</hi> which it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he cannot be, if he be <hi>true God,</hi> and <hi>Consubstantial</hi> with his Father,) and therefore that the dignity of his person doth add <hi>pondus</hi>
                     <note n="3" place="bottom">Limb. Lib. 3. Cap. 22. Sect. 5.</note>
                     <hi>immensum,</hi> a great weight to his sufferings. But then the question farther will be: whether the <hi>dignity of his nature</hi> did add any such <hi>dignity to his sufferings,</hi> so as, <hi>sua vi &amp; efficacia,</hi> that by their own force and efficacy they could, and did expiate sin? no, they say it did not; the sacrifice which Christ offered was indeed <hi>sufficient</hi> for this purpose, but <hi>this sufficiencie,</hi> notwithstanding the great worth and exellence of his nature, is to be resolved into the divine will and pleasure. God required no other nor greater price for the redemption of mankind, <hi>sed in hac unica victima acquievit;</hi> he did rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this one oblation which Christ made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>But if this be all that is to be owned concerning the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Christ, we are but where we were before. And then the sacrifice of Christ, whatever other worth it might
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62459:166"/> acquire from the dignity of his nature, acquired no proper force and virtue to expiate sin; and therefore, (if so) we must say again, that in point of <hi>efficacy</hi> it did not <hi>exceed</hi> the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Law; and <hi>that his blood,</hi> if considered in it self, did not any more than that of Calves and Goats, <hi>take away sin;</hi> nay <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it was impossible it should do so. Which must needs be a harsh and unpleasing doctrine to any Christians ears, as we said before, which have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to another sort of sound.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand we think our selves obliged to affirm, that the death and sufferings of our Savior by their <hi>own efficacy,</hi> arising indeed from the infinite worth of his person, <hi>did take away sin,</hi> and <hi>purge the Conscience</hi> which was sensible of the guilt, and in great dread of punishment. And if you enquire wherein this efficacy did consist; we answer as we did before, it did consist in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That his sufferings for us, did bear <hi>a just proportion,</hi> and were <hi>equivalent</hi> to the sufferings and punishment of all mankind, and thereby he made <hi>a full, perfect and sufficient obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world.</hi> And this is that which the <hi>Fathers of old</hi> constantly affirmed; so that it is no new doctrine, but that which was always believed and maintained by the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> as will appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Testimonies, which, among a great many other that might be produced to this purpose, I have made choice of, as being very plain and full, and coming up to the point.</p>
                  <p>Among the works of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> are some treatises inserted, which are now generally acknowledged to be written by <hi>Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Bonneval,</hi> styled <hi>Carnotensis</hi> from the <hi>Diocess</hi> in which that <hi>Abby</hi> was situated, wherein he speaks very fully on this Subject.

                        </gap>physical subtleties</hi> were introduced into our Religion with which the <hi>ancient Church</hi> was unacquainted. It is true <hi>Arnoldus</hi> lived in the same <hi>Century</hi> with <hi>Lombard,</hi> and <hi>Anselm</hi> flourished in that preceding, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> and succeeded <hi>Lanfranc</hi> in the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who is said to be the first that began this way of writing in the <hi>Western Church,</hi> in imitation of what had been three ages before attempted by <hi>John Damascen</hi> in the <hi>Greek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this can be no prejudice to their opinion in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, because they hereby did not introduce any novel doctrine,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62459:167"/> which the former and better ages were not acquainted with: but did tread in the steps of their forefathers, and delivered what they found generally embraced by the whole <hi>Church,</hi> and which made up part of the faith of all sound Christians in these and former ages.

                  <p>I shall instance but in one Father more, and that is St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who in his Exposition on the <hi>5th</hi> Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans v.</hi> 17. affirms, that Christ did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharge <hi>our debt,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, so much the more, as that our whole debt bore no greater a proportion to it, than a drop of water doth to the immense Ocean. Here is the doctrine, not only of <hi>equivalents,</hi> but even of <hi>exsuperants</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a witness. And I believe neither <hi>Anselm</hi> nor <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> nor <hi>Thomas,</hi> nor <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> nor any other the most subtil and Metaphysical Schoolman, could deliver himself more fully, or as some perhaps may think, hyperbolically upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                  <p>By all which it plainly appears what the opinion of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> was, concerning the end and design of Christs dying for us, which was that he might thereby satisfy the justice of his Father for our sins. And whatever other ways the infinite
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62459:169"/> wisdom of God might have found out for the redemption and salvation of mankind, yet the reason why he contrived and pitched upon this method in their opinion was, because it was the fittest way for the vindicating his authority, and giving satisfaction to his justice, I mean a <hi>full and plenary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And with these expressions of the Fathers, agree the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of our Church, frequently made by her in her Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, Liturgy, and Homilies: particularly in the first Sermon concerning the Salvation of mankind; where we are told, <hi>that God sent his onely son our Savior Christ into the world, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law for us, and by shedding his most precious blood, to make a sacrifice and satisfaction, or (as it may be called) amends to his Father for our sins, to asswage his wrath and indignation conceived against us for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he same.</hi> And in the Conclusion of that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. <hi>That whereas all the world was not able of themselves to pay any part towards their Ransome: It pleased our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his infinite mercy to prepare for us the most precious Jewels of Christs Body and Blood, whereby our ransome might he fully paid, the Law fulfilled, and his justice fully satisfyed.</hi> By all that hath been said upon this head, I think we have made it sufficiently to appear, that the <hi>end and reasons</hi> of Christs sufferings do clearly demonstrate, that they were <hi>equivalent</hi> to the punishment of all mankind.</p>
                  <p>This will be farther evident in the second place from the consideration of their inward worth and dignity, arising in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from the superlative eminence and dignity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suffering; who was the eternal son of God, and <hi>God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ever.</hi> 'Twas he who purchased and redeemed <hi>his Church with his own blood.</hi> Indeed the sufferings of our Savior if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in themselves, abstracting from the divinity of his person, could not be of such extraordinary excellence and value as we now contend for. The <hi>pains</hi> that he endured in his body it is true were very acute and grievous. The <hi>fear and horror</hi> which he was under from the apprehensions of his Fathers wrath, and indignation against sin, (of which to be sure he had a clear, and sensible view when he stood in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62459:170"/> room of sinners;) and the <hi>anguish and agonies</hi> of his Soul which were consequent thereunto, tho exquisitely and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressibly great; so that he might cry out, <hi>was ever any sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger?</hi> yet for all this they were but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, because terminated in his humane nature which was so.</p>
                  <p>For this reason, as his sufferings before, and upon the Cross, were <hi>extensively</hi> and in their duration finite, it was impossible that <hi>intensively</hi> and with respect to any degrees of pain, they should be infinite; and consequently they could not be equal to the punishment of all mankind. But then we are farther to consider, that this humane nature, made up of that body, and soul in which he suffered, was united to the Divine word: and this gave them <hi>pondus immensum</hi> saith <hi>Limb.</hi> nay <hi>valor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> aequalitas,</hi> a just proportion and equality between the thing given and received, the action and the reward; and consequently that if the sufferings of our Savior are <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi> of pardon, they must be equivalent <hi>malo &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seriae è qua redempti sumus;</hi> to that guilt and misery from which we are redeemed.

                  <p>Nor in the second place is it needful, I hope, to prove, that the sufferings of our Savior were <hi>truly and properly</hi> meritoriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants being at perfect agreement in this matter. And the declarations of our own Church about it are so frequently made, and so fully expressed, that she hath left no room for doubt or scruple concerning her sense of it. Nay she doth not only believe this doctrine concerning the merits of Christ to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62459:170"/> be <hi>true▪</hi> but likewise so <hi>important a truth,</hi> that she hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <note n="1" place="bottom">This faith the holy Scripture teacheth us. (<hi>viz.</hi> concerning the merits of Christs precious blood as the true cause of our justification) this is the strong rock and foundation of the Christian Religion: this doctrine all old and ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Christs Church do approve: this doctrine advanceth and setteth forth the true glory of Christ, and beateth down the vain glory of man: this whosoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth is not to be accounted for a Christian man &amp;c. <hi>The third part of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Salvation.</hi>
                     </note>, that to deny it is in effect to renounce the Christian Religion. And for any man to pretend to be a member of this Church, and yet to make any doubt of the truth of that, which she so often affirms, and which she requires all her devout Children in their solemn addresses to Heaven to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, as the only ground of their confidence, and the true bottom upon which they can place their hopes of pardon and acceptance: I say after all this for any to pretend to be of <hi>her Communion,</hi> and yet either <hi>deny,</hi> or indeed <hi>doubt of it:</hi> is such a degree of prevarication. that we cannot easily find words to express the scandal and impiety of it. Now from both these things it must plainly follow, that the doctrine of <hi>Christ's merits,</hi> and the doctrine of <hi>Equivalents,</hi> must either both be received or both be rejected, and must stand or fall together.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps for all this it will be said, that <hi>Calvin</hi> and some other <hi>Protestant Divines,</hi> deny the <hi>merits of</hi> Christ strictly so called, and say his sufferings are only meritorious by divine acceptation. To which I answer, that tho the Divine acceptation (as we have allways affirmed) is absolutely necessary to render them effectually such to us; yet their merit is originally founded in their internal worth and dignity, and that <hi>equality</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> which is to be found between them and the reward, to which they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here the reformed divines, and particularly <hi>Calvin,</hi> (who is railed at by <hi>Vasquez,</hi> and mentioned by <hi>Limb.</hi> with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for so doing) upon good reason dissents from these Schoolmen; and rightly states this matter, as we formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served: <hi>viz.</hi> that the sufferings of Christ, tho of <hi>infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi>

                  <p>Lastly; as the <hi>worth and dignity</hi> of our Saviors sufferings prove them to be <hi>equivalent</hi> to the punishment of all mankind; so the <hi>effect and consequence</hi> of them are a clear demonstration of it likewise. For he underwent what the Law threatned, and our guilt rendered us obnoxious to: and we are thereby for ever freed from the obligation to punishment. I mean <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> whose anger is pacified, and his justice is fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62459:172"/> so that he requires no new sacrifice, exacts no new suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from us to entitle us to pardon: because our Savior by that one oblation of himself made upon the Cross, having <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal redemption for us,</hi> and having thereby <hi>perfected for ever them that are sanctified;</hi> all that he now expects from us, are as we said before, <hi>repentance from dead works,</hi> and <hi>faith in his son,</hi> without which the redemption purchased will not be available to us; because without those conditions, as God in honor and justice cannot bestow, so neither are we capable of receiving those benefits, which Christ by dying in our stead hath merited for us.</p>
                  <p>But otherwise, all that was necessary to appease the anger of God, and to purchase pardon for sinners, hath been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly performed by our Savior; who having <hi>undergone the sentence,</hi> and submitted to the <hi>punishment of the Law,</hi> in our room and stead, hath discharged us from the obligation to it. For hereby as the Apostle tells us, <hi>He hath blotted out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was against us, and which was contrary to us,</hi> Col. 2. v. 14.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Ordinances</hi> there are meant, both the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> from the obligation to which we (both Jews and Gentiles) are delivered by the Oross, that is the death of Christ; but not in the <hi>same way and manner.</hi> By his death we are entirely freed from any obligation to <hi>the observance</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and from the <hi>curse and condemnation</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law; which therefore might be said to be <hi>against us,</hi> because it being not fulfilled and obeyed by any in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and perfection which was required, it subjected all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to the Curse annexed to the violation of it. The Law then was a <hi>Chirographum,</hi> a written testimony, sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us before God, and render us obnoxious to his justice, <hi>as a bond doth a debtor.</hi> But the force of this even the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as to its <hi>condemning part,</hi> was evacuated and disanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the death of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And this is fully and emphatically expressed by the Apostle by three phrases, which denote the total abolition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the power and obligation of this hand-writing, or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62459:173"/> written Law, I mean as to what concerns the punishment threatned by it. <note n="1" place="bottom">See the <hi>Oxford Paraphrase</hi> upon this Text.</note>
                     <hi>1st. It was blotted out and cancelled as men do a Bond when it is discharged.</hi> 2dly, <hi>He took it out of the way, so that it should never after be produced, or he forth coming to accuse or convince us</hi> Lastly, <hi>He nailed it to his Cross, rending it as it were with the nails of his Cross, and thereby tearing it to pieces, as men do a bond after it is cancelled,</hi> which is then done, <hi>cum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quod debebatur solutum est;</hi> our Savior hereby discovering and declaring to the world, that he had undertaken and suffered the penalty and condemnation due to the forfeiters of that Bond.</p>
                  <p>Neither can all this be resolved into divine acceptation and pleasure; because the intention and design of the Apostle was to set forth and declare to the world both Jews and Gentiles, not only the <hi>riches of Gods grace</hi> in the forgiveness of sin, but likewise the <hi>mighty power and efficacy</hi> of Christs death, whereby it was procured and purchased. Which appears by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, when in the next verse he tells us, that by thus disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the condemning force of the Law, he <hi>spoiled the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of darkness, and <hi>those principalities</hi> of evil Spirits, who hereby were devested of that power and jurisdiction whereby they ruled over us as their Slaves and Captives; nay he <hi>made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now if the death of Christ had no other dignity and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy but what was owing purely to divine estimation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; Then I say it could not bear such a loftiness and sublimity of expression, with which it is set forth by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: neither could our Savior with any regard to fitness and decency, be represented, as he here is, sitting as it were in state, adorned with the glorious and magnificent titles of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and triumph,</hi> encompassed with the spoils of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62459:173"/> as so many trophies of his victories over them: Because ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this opinion, if we consider things impartially, we shall find that what he did was very little and inconsiderable to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>dyed for us</hi> indeed, but his death if considered in it self, was but a very feeble impotent business: it had no <hi>power</hi> to effect, no <hi>worth and dignity</hi> to procure and merit our redemption. The Devil, it is true, the great enemy of our salvation, is now vanquished, and he who <hi>bruised the heel</hi> of our Savior is now placed under his and <hi>our feet;</hi> but this is owing not to the <hi>passion of Christ,</hi> but to the <hi>power of God,</hi> and our deliverance from his tyranny is to be ascribed solely to divine grace and favor. And if it had not been for <hi>that,</hi> we must still have continued under the guilt of our sins and the dominion of the Devil, notwithstanding any efficacy that we may imagine was in the death of Christ; whose <hi>cross</hi> would only have been a monument of the injustice and cruelty of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> but no <hi>trophie</hi> of his power and conquest over sin and Hell; as the Christian world hath hitherto vainly fancyed. But I shall forbear enlarging any farther on this subject. By what hath been said, I think it plainly appears that the <hi>death</hi> of our Savior, whereby as a <hi>priest</hi> he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a sacrifice to divine justice, was <hi>equivalent</hi> to the death and punishment of all mankind: and therefore (that we may bring both parts of our argument together) that it was a clear proof of his <hi>Divinity.</hi> And for such it was allways acknowledged and urged by the <hi>Fathers</hi> when they discoursed of this matter. For when the question at any time was put, how the sufferings of Christ could suffice to purchase pardon and mercy for the whole world, they allways resolved the efficacy of them into the <hi>divine nature</hi> which was united to the <hi>humane</hi> in which he suffered. He <hi>only did,</hi> and he <hi>only could</hi> redeem us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Nestorius</hi> had lived in our days, he might have answered for himself, as some now do: It is true by asserting <hi>two persons</hi> as well as <hi>two natures</hi> in Christ, I must acknowledge that he was a meer man that dyed for us, and consequently that the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an <hi>Humane person,</hi> could receive no virtue or dignity from the <hi>Divine person</hi> to which he was united, and which did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit and dwell in him <note n="2" place="bottom">In this cohabitation or indwelling consisted the great mystery of the <hi>Hypostatick union,</hi> as it was explained by <hi>Nestorius;</hi> which explication of his was censured and condemned in the before mentioned Council of <hi>Ephesus. Vide Cyrill. Exeg. ad Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. Concil. Eph. Par. 3. Cap. 40. p. 1160. Et Nestorii Anathematismos Cyrilli A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath. oppositos par. 1.

                     </note>. Neither is there any need that this should be done; for their efficacy doth not arise either from the <hi>worthyness of the person,</hi> or the <hi>dignity of those sufferings:</hi> They may without this, be still all sufficient, because their sufficiency
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62459:176"/> depends only on the divine pleasure and acceptation. But those Fathers were strangers to this sort of <hi>Divinity;</hi> who allways be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that no less a recompense would be accepted of by God, than that which <hi>was equal</hi> to the guilt and demerit of mankind, and that none therefore could make it but he who was God as well as man.</p>
                  <p>I should tire the Reader if I should cite all the Testimonies of the other Fathers, which might be produced to this purpose. And indeed I have been the longer upon this subject, in citing and insisting on the former authorities from the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that I might rescue this doctrine concerning our Saviors satisfaction from the reflections cast upon it, as if it were only a <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical nicety,</hi> and the <hi>invention of the Schoolmen:</hi> which now by some is thought to be so great a disparagement to any opinion, that you need not add any thing farther to expose it to contempt, and indeed to the detestation of the readers. But by what hath been produced I hope it sufficiently appears that this was the doctrine of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> allways professed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Fathers long before any such persons as the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> were ever heard of in the world. And what they say upon this subject may be reduced to these four Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> That whatever methods the divine wisdom might have contrived for the Salvation of Mankind, yet the way that he pitched upon was, by demanding a <hi>plenary, adequate satisfaction</hi> for those wrongs and injuries that were done to his authority by the violation of his Laws. <hi>2dly,</hi> That it was not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Man or Angel, or any other creature, to afford any such <hi>compensation</hi> to divine justice. Because, <hi>ex perfecta justitia,</hi> the expiation of Sin could not be accomplished but by such suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as were of <hi>infinite value. 3dly,</hi> That our Savior by dying for us did make a <hi>sufficient recompence</hi> to that justice. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and authority of God being fully and in a more eminent manner vindicated <hi>by his death,</hi> than injured by <hi>our disobedience.</hi> So that his punishment did not only <hi>equal,</hi> but indeed <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate</hi> our guilt. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That this was a clear proof of his Divinity. <hi>The Church of God was redeemed by his blood;</hi> the <hi>price</hi> therefore which he paid was of <hi>unspeakable value:</hi> the <hi>sacrifice</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:62459:176"/> which he offered was of <hi>immense,</hi> nay <hi>infinite virtue;</hi> the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> which he underwent was <hi>equivalent</hi> to the sufferings of all mankind. This shews him to be God, because none less than God could lay down <hi>such a price,</hi> offer such <hi>a sacrifice,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo such <hi>sufferings</hi> as were of this immense worth, this infinite force and efficacy.</p>
                  <p>And thus at length I have finished what I had to say upon this Head: and I hope have hereby made it sufficiently to appear that <hi>Faith</hi> as it is terminated upon <hi>the person</hi> of Christ is a necessary indispensable duty; and that the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and <hi>Episcop.</hi> (which by confounding faith and obedience, makes the <hi>former,</hi> as it bespeaks the <hi>perswasion of the</hi> mind concerning the truths of the Gospel, and particularly that great truth, that Christ is the natural and eternal son of God, an useless and indifferent matter) is <hi>highly dishonorable</hi> to our Savior. And this was the first mischievous consequence which we affirmed, necessarily attends this opinion; because, without this perswasion concerning <hi>the nature</hi> of Christ, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have that <hi>inward</hi> esteem and reverence for him as becomes us; we cannot make him those <hi>outward acknowledgments,</hi> nor pay him those external actions of Homage and worship which the Scriptures require of us. Nor lastly, can we truly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly own him to be <hi>the Messiah;</hi> because he could not execute the offices, nor perform the functions which belonged to him as <hi>the Messiah,</hi> except he were <hi>God,</hi> as well as man. And if so, then this perswasion of the mind concerning the Divine nature or Godhead of our Savior, is, <hi>fatentibus adversariis,</hi> absolutely necessary to Salvation, and that without which we cannot be Christians. The Primitive Christians could not conceive how it was possible for any person to be our Savior, who was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise our God. Therefore if it be necessary to believe Christ to be our Savior, it must at the same time (according to them) be necessary to believe him to be God.</p>
                  <p>And so I come to consider the second pernicious consequence which flows from it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is highly pernicious to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Christian Church</hi> which is established upon it,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62459:177"/> and tends plainly to undermine and overturn them both. And this I shall endeavor to make out, with relation first to the Doctrine, and then secondly to the practice of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st</hi> Then, as to what concerns the doctrine, I say that <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his followers, by confounding <hi>faith and obedience,</hi> and accounting the former, as it bespeaks <hi>the perswasion of the mind</hi> concerning the truths of the Gospel, an useless or at best an indifferent matter; plainly lay the foundations of infidelity, and thereby betray the Christian Religion, and deliver up the Doctrines of it into the hands of its enemies, both those <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and those <hi>without</hi> the pale of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st</hi> As to the former, such I mean, who take upon them the name and profession of Christians, (and therefore in a large general sense may be said to be within the Pale of the Church) and yet hold several pernicious and impious opinions, such as have been vended and published both in former and latter ages by divers bold and presumtuous persons, (such as were the <hi>Cerinthians, Carpocratians, Valentinians, Marcionites</hi> of old; <hi>Ʋnitarians, Anabaptists</hi> (especially the <hi>Munsterian</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> sorts) <hi>Familists, Muggletonians, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> of later times) to the great detriment and scandal of the Christian Religion, whereby the peace of the Church hath been disturbed, and the purity of its doctrines corrupted and depraved: 'Tis certain all these, together with the opinions published by them, (whether they are owing to <hi>rapture and enthusiasme,</hi> or are the product of a more <hi>calm and deliberate contrivance,</hi> in this case it matters not) receive too great countenance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this notion. For since a good life is not only the principal end of all Religion, but consists <hi>solely</hi>

                     </note>, as they tell us, in the <hi>Practice of Piety</hi> and virtue; what need any man be concerned about his <hi>Faith,</hi> and the perswasion of his mind, concerning the <hi>doctrines</hi> of the Gospel, provided he yields obedience to the <hi>precepts</hi> of it; which obedience they say, is the summe and substance of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Now it is certain, that <hi>probity,</hi> which is the main thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and recommended by <hi>Socinus,</hi> consisting in the exercise of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62459:177"/>
                     <hi>Justice, Charity, and Temperance, &amp;c.</hi> and other moral vertues, may be, and hath been consistent with divers false and erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions concerning the mysteries of Religion and the Articles of our Faith: and if so, from hence it must follow (I mean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this notion advanced by <hi>Socinus</hi>) that it matters not what apprehensions you have of these <hi>latter;</hi> nor particularly what opinions you entertain of the <hi>person and nature</hi> of Christ: whether you conceive him to be <hi>God or Man;</hi> the son of <hi>God,</hi> or the son of <hi>Joseph:</hi> whether you think he existed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or think he had no existence antecedent to his being born of the Virgin; whether you believe him to be <hi>one person,</hi> or divided <hi>into two:</hi> whether you think he consists of <hi>two natures,</hi> or after the union of both, whether they are so blended and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as to make up <hi>but one:</hi> That is, whether you are an <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For supposing the opinions before mentioned, or others of the like nature, to be opposite to the truth, yet forasmuch as they are not inconsistent with Piety, there can be no harm or danger in them. The persons who maintained them might be <hi>men of probity,</hi> and if so, the holyness of their Lives makes a sufficient atonement for the errors of their understanding, which at most are inconsiderable, and therefore very pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mistakes.

They disown their doctrines in some measure it's true, but yet maintain a friendship and correspondence with the Authors of them, and give them the right hand of fellowship.</p>
                  <p>They complement their persons, extol their piety, excuse, extenuate, make apologies for their mistakes, and proclaim to the world, that they know no harm nor malignity that is in them. Thus like <hi>Judas</hi> they <hi>betray their Savior with a kiss,</hi> and at the same time that they pretend to salute and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his person, and embrace his doctrines, they do really deliver up both into the hands of his professed enemies.</p>
                  <p>I know it will be here said, in behalf of both these before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> that they are so far from disowning the <hi>usefulness,</hi> that they preach up the <hi>necessity of Faith,</hi> and upon all occasions declare, that to believe <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah,</hi> is a duty of absolute and indispensable obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without which we cannot be Christians. To which I answer, that this very belief, which is all that they require of us, may be, and hath been consistent with divers, and those very dangerous errors, which plainly subvert the foundations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. And particularly in the primitive Church, sundry persons there were, who tho they did not totally revolt from the profession of the Christian Religion, but openly professed and believed <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah,</hi> yet for all this fell into many wild and desperate opinions, for which they were then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd still have been justly reputed <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Corpocratians</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians,</hi> against whom St. <hi>Jude</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> are supposed to write their Epistles, are styled by them <hi>ungodly men,</hi> and their errors, <hi>damnable heresies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. for by denying the divine nature of Christ, and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be only a man, tho at the same time they owned him to be <hi>the Messiah;</hi> they are said by those inspired writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>to deny the Lord that bought them, Jude</hi> 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Judaizing Christians,</hi> against whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote especially in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> come under the like
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62459:179"/> Censure and Condemnation. For tho they did in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, yet forasmuch as at the same time they did likewise believe that they were under a necessary obligation to observe the <hi>Ceremonial Law;</hi> they did thereby evacuate the force, and destroy the excellency of their former Faith; and reduced themselves into a condition as bad as that of Infidels. For by this perswasion, <hi>they did fall from Grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. And while they continued in it, the Apostle assures them that <hi>Christ would be of no effect to them,</hi> or which is the same in other word▪ <hi>would profit them nothing,</hi> v. 2. That is, they should receive no advantage by any thing that Christ either did or suffered for their sakes. For which reason the Apostle chides them severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; upbraids them with their Levity and inconstancy in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith, charges them with folly and stupidity, that they should so soon be removed from the grace of Christ, and the obedience of the truth, which was so plainly preached, and so fully and evidently set forth before their Eyes, that except they were blinded or bewitched they must be forced to acknowledge it.</p>
                  <p>I confess if we were to be governed by the opinions of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> and his friends, (formerly published, and which do of late too much prevail) we might justly wonder why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle should be so positive and so severe, and draw up so heavy a charge against the <hi>Judaizing Christians,</hi> upon the account of their mistakes in this matter. Did they renounce the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, and by a total revolt to <hi>Judaisme</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him, whom formerly they owned to <hi>be the Messiah?</hi> No they did not. How then could they be said to introduce a <hi>new Gospel</hi> who professed and maintained the great, nay the <hi>only fundamental</hi> article of it? Why should it be said that <hi>Christ would profit them nothing,</hi> who reverenced his person, submitted to his authority, obeyed his precepts; and in short, according to the opinion of these men, acknowledged all that was necessary <hi>to be believed,</hi> and performed all that was necessary <hi>to be practised?</hi> For the observation of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> was not inconsistent with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> For both <hi>Christ</hi> himself and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> those great patterns of vertue and holyness, for some
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62459:179"/> time shewed themselves conformable to both. Wherein then did the malignity of this error of theirs consist, which should bring them under so great and heavy a Censure? Why it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in this, that tho they acknowledged <hi>Jesus to be the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> or the Christ, (otherwise they could not have been esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christians) yet they did not own him to be so in the full import and signification of that word. They would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be <hi>their King,</hi> and as such were ready to obey his Laws: but they would not accept of, and own him to be <hi>their Savior,</hi> I mean a complete and perfect Savior. They expected justification <hi>by the works of the Law</hi> but not <hi>by the Faith of Christ,</hi> or at least partly <hi>by the Law,</hi> and partly <hi>by Christ;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they clearly evacuated the force and efficacy of Christs death, and overthrew the end and reason of it, which was to purchase pardon of sin, and eternal Salvation for us.</p>
                  <p>In short, they did hereby <hi>frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 21. Now this was plainly to undermine the <hi>Gospel of Christ,</hi> and to introduce <hi>a new one</hi> in its room; and whoever attempts to do so, whether he be <hi>Man or Angel,</hi> deserves to be censured with an <hi>Anathema, Gal.</hi> 1. 7. From whence it must follow, that there are more Articles than that one concerning <hi>the Messiah</hi> which are necessary to be believed; and more errors conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently destructive of Salvation, besides that one of denying <hi>Jesus to be the Christ,</hi> if we believe St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But he perhaps may be thought to be a hot-headed fiery zealot, who out of a contentious humor, and a concern for I know not what opinions of his own, disturbed the peace of the world, and <hi>turned it upside down. Socinus</hi> was a person of more wisdom and temper; he hath brought down Religion out of the Clouds, and hath reduced it, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did of old, all from specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to practice. There is but one thing necessary, and that is obedience.</p>
                  <p>But doth not the Scripture say we are to <hi>believe in Christ?</hi> Yes, but that is only another word for <hi>obedience,</hi> if we believe <hi>Socinus,</hi> as was formerly observed. I pray you let us examine this matter a little more particularly, lest hereby we may
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62459:180"/> be led into some great and dangerous mistake before we are well aware.</p>
                  <p>If we look into the <hi>Gospels</hi> we shall find the holy Pen-men of them very careful in giving us, an exact account of the <hi>birth</hi> of our Savior, the manner and circumstances of his <hi>life, death, resurrection,</hi> and <hi>ascension into Heaven.</hi> The matter of fact is delivered by the <hi>Evangelists;</hi> the grounds, ends, and reasons of this whole dispensation, are more fully declared and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>the Epistles</hi> which they wrote, directed indeed to some particular Persons or Churches, but designed for the lasting benefit of all Christians▪ in all succeeding ages of the world. Now these things are faithfully recorded, frequently inculcated, and insisted upon by them, as matters of great importance, in the knowledge of which we are nearly concerned; and therefore they take all this pains sufficiently to instruct us, that we might thereby be fully perswaded of the truth of them. These things are written, saith St. <hi>John, That yee may believe that Jesus is the son of God, and that believing ye might have life thro his name,</hi> Jo. 20. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It is true indeed Christ now in Heaven is the noble ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, and the great support of it: But is it not requisite likewise to believe that he <hi>dyed for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification?</hi> No: for tho our Salvation may in some measure be owing to Christs death and resurrection, yet for all that, it is of no great consequence, to be perswaded of them, because our justification doth not depend on any such knowledge or perswasion.

                  <p>Now this we must needs say is a very mischievous positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, advanced in direct opposition to the whole tenor of the Gospel, and to the express declarations of what Christ and his Apostles have so often made upon this occasion. For doth not the Angel who appeared to <hi>Joseph</hi> in a dream, give him this as the reason why the Child which was conceived by the <hi>Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his wife, should be <hi>called Jesus,</hi> viz. <hi>because he should save his people from their Sins?</hi> Math. 1. 21. and doth not that same <hi>Jesus</hi> acquaint his Disciples with the way and manner how that Salvation was to be accomplished, <hi>viz.</hi> by the shedding of his blood? <hi>This is my blood which is shed for the remission of Sins,</hi> Mat. 26. 28.

                  <p>Is it not fit therefore that the ground and reason of our Saviors coming into the world, and the way whereby he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased remission of sins for us, should be known and believed by us? No, saith <hi>Socinus,</hi>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62459:181"/> all the People tell them, that <hi>he was the living bread which came down from Heaven</hi> and that this <hi>bread was his flesh which he would give for the life of the world,</hi> Jo. 6. 51. And at another time, that <hi>he was the good Shepherd, who would lay down his life for</hi> his <hi>sheep?</hi> Jo. 10. 15.</p>
                  <p>It must be confessed that he did say all this; but as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of these two Texts, <hi>Socinus</hi> did not think fit to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; whether out of forgetfulness or design, let the Reader judge. And as for the latter, they contain only, as he tells us, a general declaration of Christs love to his people, which was so great, that he could be content, if there were occasion for it, to lay down his life in order to save theirs. And nothing more can be collected from Christs words in that place. But as for that main point, <hi>viz.</hi> that pardon of sins was to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>shedding of his blood for us,</hi> this was not known either by the common people among the Jews, nor by their Elders or Rulers; nay nor by the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ himself; and therefore it cannot be necessary that it should be known and believed by us, nor can the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of it have any influence upon our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So <hi>Socinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, as to what concerns the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, those things either as to the matter of fact, or the ends and reasons of them, were not so plainly understood and believed by the Jews in general, or by his own Disciples in particular, as might reasonably be expected from such who were conversant in the writings of the old Testament, where these matters were plainly enough delivered. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find our Savior upbraiding his Disciples with their <hi>folly and slowness of heart to believe all that the Prophets had spoken</hi> on this subject. Afterwards he drew the vail away that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, removed the prejudices which they lay under, and <hi>opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures:</hi> and shewed them plainly <hi>that thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day,</hi> Luke 24. 46. And what he thus informed them of, he commanded them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to publish to the world: for he appointed them to <hi>be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62459:182"/> his witnesses of these things</hi> v. 48. Jo. 15. 27. And accordingly we find them in pursuance of their Commission, every where and upon all occasions testifying these things, and with great power <hi>giving witness of his Resurrection,</hi> and consequently of his death, both these being necessarily joined together. I shall not trouble the Reader with multiplicity of examples in this matter. Let it suffice to instance in what St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares upon this occasion to the <hi>Corinthians, Epist. 1. ch. 15. viz.</hi> That the summe of the Gospel which he Preached to them was, <hi>that Christ dyed for our sins, and rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,</hi> v. 3, 4. This was that Gospel <hi>which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> and by which alone <hi>they could be Saved;</hi> this they are required <hi>to keep in memory, i. e.</hi> frequently to meditate upon and firmly to believe it, otherwise whatever else they <hi>had believed,</hi> would be altogether <hi>vain</hi> and insignificant, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and <hi>v. 14. If Christ be not risen, then is our Preaching vain, and your Faith is also vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well? but tho it should be allowed, that it is not necessary to believe the Birth, Death, and Resurrection of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this brings us <hi>backward,</hi> and engages us to look after <hi>what is past;</hi> yet ought we not to have a firm belief, of <hi>the Ascension</hi> of Christ into Heaven, and that he there lives, <hi>ever making intercession for us?</hi> because this may and doth respect <hi>Tempus futurum,</hi> (as <hi>Socinus</hi> before stated this matter) not only what Christ hath done, but what he continues still to do, and will be doing to the end of the World.

For if you desire to be satisfied in that important question concerning your justification, and the remission of sin; and if you would reap any benefit and advantage by that enquiry, then you must not be much concerned about the <hi>external causes</hi> of it, <hi>ea quae extra nos sunt,</hi> for <hi>vis praecipua quaestionis non circa illa versatur;</hi> the stress of the enquiry must not ly there, <hi>viz.</hi> upon those things which are without us, such as are <hi>the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, the person of Christ, together with all those things which the same Christ either already hath, or hereafter shall do for us.</hi> These are extrinsical and forreign to the purpose; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>quae supra, sed quae extra nos, nihil ad nos;</hi> and therefore there is no reason, <hi>cur de iis admodum soliciti simus,</hi> that we should trouble our heads or disturb our rest, by any fruitless and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts about them.</p>
                  <p>As if he should say, recal your wandring thoughts from gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad, and gazing upon those things which are either <hi>above or about you;</hi> and turn them <hi>all inward;</hi> see if you have repentance and a reformation wrought within you, and for other things which are without you, <hi>viz. the mercy of God and the merits of Christ,</hi> you need not be solicitous or much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about them.</p>
                  <p>This is the resolution of this great <hi>Casuist,</hi> in that important case about our <hi>Justification;</hi> which if it were to be put into the words and language of the <hi>Quakers</hi> it would amount to this, that we should not so much look after a <hi>Christ without,</hi> as a <hi>Christ within us;</hi> and that the true mystery of Godlyness, is <hi>Christ manifested in his Children.</hi> For what the one expresses in more plain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon termes, the other choose to deliver in their enthusiastick unintelligible Cant; but the design of both is the same, <hi>viz.</hi> to take us off from our Faith and relyance upon the <hi>incarnation and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62459:183"/> sufferings of our Savior,</hi> which the whole Christian world have as they say, too long and lazily depended upon.</p>
                  <p>These indeed we are taught to acknowledge to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of our hopes, I mean as to the procuring and meritorious cause of mercy and pardon: and here we think we are safe; but from this confidence these seducers would fain withdraw us; and would perswade us to build upon a more slippery and unstable bottom, to rely upon <hi>a reed that will be shaken with every wind; viz.</hi> those virtuous <note n="1" place="bottom">For tho' when we speak of the application of pardon, those good dispositions, are conditions absolutely requisite to render us capable of it; yet the true, proper procuring cause of remission of sins are the passion and merits of our Savior, which we must fly to, and rely upon; otherwise all that we can do, will be useless and insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant to this purpose.</note> dispositions of mind, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> comprehend under the general name of <hi>probity</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> call the <hi>inward and spiritual appearance of Christ in the Conscience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Socinus.</hi> By what we have produced out of him one would think, if what he saith be true, that it should not be so necessary as is generally imagined, to believe <hi>Jesus to be the Messiah;</hi> for if it be not necessary to believe that he was born, that he dyed and rose again, ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot imagine why it should be necessary that we should have any knowledge of him at all. It is true this is said to be necessary, but if men may speak freely and impartially, we may venture to affirm, that it is not such an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as we are under any indispensable obligation of believing. No? how comes <hi>Socinus</hi> then so often and so peremptorily to affirme it.</p>
                  <p>It is true he doth so, but it is with a just reservation. It is necessary this should be acknowledged; that is generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with regard to men, but not so absolutely necessary if you consider things in themselves. I mean thus: a good life consisting in a conformity to the precepts of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is the only thing that is acceptable to God, and desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it self: but forasmuch as you cannot, or rather foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it may be presumed that generally speaking, men will
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62459:183"/> not <hi>obey the Laws</hi> of Christ who do not <hi>own his authority;</hi> therefore it becomes necessary to believe him to be <hi>the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> or King: that is, it is <hi>accidentally</hi>

                  <p>But is it not a point of respect due to our Savior to have just and honorable conceptions <hi>of his person,</hi> and that indeed which is the foundation of all other external expressions of Homage and duty?

Right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be said by some, it is not much material to know, and therefore we need not trouble our selves to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be the <hi>Eternal son of God,</hi> who in time took upon him our nature, whereby the <hi>two natures</hi> humane and divine came to be united in <hi>one person;</hi> these are Metaphysical niceties not much to be regarded.

                  <p>This indeed one would reasonably think should be absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary, if it be at all necessary to believe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; because if he were not <hi>a true man</hi> at least, one might imagine that it were impossible for him to be the <hi>true

                  <p>Let us a little consider it.

                  <p>And there was great reason for this caution and advice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this opinion of theirs is so pernicious and execrable, that no words can sufficiently express the danger and impiety of it. It doth not only undermine the authority, but directly overthrows the truth of the holy Scriptures. It is infinitely dishonorable to Christ and his Apostles; and plainly overturns the whole frame and design of the Christian Religion, which, if this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be true, must be a <hi>downright falshood</hi> from first to last, and the <hi>greatest cheat</hi> that ever was imposed on the world.</p>
                  <p>The Apostles and Evangelists give us an account of his Mother who conceived and brought him forth, as also of all his and her Ancestors from whom he <hi>as to the flesh</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended. They say he <hi>took upon him the seed of Abraham,</hi> and was <hi>partaker of flesh and blood</hi> as the rest of his brethren; to whom he was in all points like, sin only excepted. For he was liable to the same natural infirmitys of hunger and thirst and wearyness as we all are; eating and drinking, and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as other men are wont to do.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, say the Disciples of <hi>Saturninus, Basilides,</hi> and the rest of that Antichristian crew, he did <hi>seeme</hi> to do so, but it was only <hi>in appearance;</hi> the senses of the spectators were imposed upon, and it was all juggle and deception. But do not the Scriptures tell us that he took an human body on purpose that he might <hi>dye for us,</hi> and accordingly that he was <hi>Crucified, dead, and buryed, and that the third day he rose from the dead?</hi> They do, it must be confessed, inform us of such matters; but yet none of all this was done in truth and reality, but only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in appearance as we said before. Well! but are not the Apostles then hereby found <hi>false witnesses of God, because they have testifyed of God that he raised up Christ;</hi> who really never dyed or was laid in the Grave, and consequently could not rise from thence? And if so, is there not an end of the Christian Religion; because by this account 1 Cor. 15. <hi>Their Preaching must be in vain, and our Faith vain; we must still be in our sins,</hi> lyable to death, and under the dominion of him <hi>that had the power of it, that is the Devil?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this must undoubtedly be true, and must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62459:185"/> from this opinion, which denies that Christ <hi>came in the flesh</hi> or took our nature upon him. But can they. therefore who maintain it, be justly esteemed our friends <hi>and brethren in Christ?</hi> yes saith <hi>Socin.</hi> they may, as long as they hold to that fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article, that <hi>Jesus is the Messiah:</hi> for these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, as we heard before, may be consistent; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of these is so powerfull an antidote against any the most pestilent heresies, that it certainly destroys the venom and malignity of them. This must be very good news to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons if it be true, and the great <hi>Socinus</hi> hath assured us of the truth of it. He hath told us so indeed, but I must beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don if I do not presently take things upon his bare word: for tho hereby he hath shewn a great charity, and concern for his <hi>Heretical brethren:</hi> yet upon examination I am afraid it will be found, that he hath had no great regard either for the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our Savior,</hi> or the <hi>welfare of the Christian Religion.</hi> The former perhaps he thought did deserve his compassion and might want his help: whilst the latter possibly might be able to shift well enough for themselves: And so indeed they must in the present case, or else they will be left in a very deplorable, helpless condition, for any assistance that <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is willing to afford them.</p>
                  <p>The question then returns concerning the Messiah, which denoting <hi>an office,</hi> suppose, that of a <hi>King and Sovereign:</hi> it must certainly be lodged in some subject; there must be some <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratum</hi> in which this authority resides, because it cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by it self. In short it must be vested in some person or nature, and what should that be? was this <hi>Jesus,</hi> this <hi>Messiah</hi> that we speak of, possessed of a <hi>divine nature?</hi> no saith <hi>Socinus</hi> that was impossible. Did he take upon him, or did he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this office in an angelical nature? no saith the Apostle, if we may believe him, <hi>he took not upon him the nature of Angels,</hi> 2. Heb. Well, did he then take upon him the <hi>nature of a man?</hi> no say the abovenamed Hereticks, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he appeared in <hi>the shape,</hi> but did not assume the true <hi>real nature of a man.</hi> No? Then he must be a cheat and Impostor, and the greatest that ever was in the world.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62459:185"/>
                  <p>He allways declared that he <hi>was a man, and the son of man.</hi> After his Resurrection he appealed to the senses of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, even to that which is least liable to mistake, <hi>viz. their feeling,</hi> for he did not only <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Luke, 24. 42. 43.</hi>
                     </note> eat and drink in their sight, but in order to cure their doubting, he did both shew them his <hi>hands and his feet,</hi> and required them to <note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>Verses 39. 40.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>handle and feel his flesh and his bones,</hi> to convince them that he was not a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or a spectre. And indeed after this proof and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he hath given us of the <hi>truth and reality</hi> of his humane nature; it is not possible for any man to conceive him to be a <hi>spirit,</hi> but he must at the same time believe that he was an <hi>Evil spirit.</hi> For the whole course and series of his pretended life, according to this opinion, must be nothing else but delusion and imposture. His actions must be all <hi>phantastical,</hi> his miracles <hi>illusions;</hi> or if they were real, they must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a diabolical force and power, <hi>and he must cast out Devils by Beelzebub the prince of them.</hi> For no <hi>good Angel</hi> could be engaged in so wicked a design, as to animate I know not what <hi>phantome</hi> and <hi>spectre,</hi> and by so doing, to contrive and carry on such a cheat as this must be, so lasting and so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to mankind.</p>
                  <p>And now is it possible for such a person to be <hi>the Messiah?</hi> Perhaps it will be answered, no, it was not possible for him to be any thing but what he pretended to be, <hi>viz.</hi> a true real man: but however some well meaning men might be under an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and misperswasion, and might <hi>think otherwise.</hi> But can they <hi>who think so,</hi> deserve the name of Christians and Brethren? For can any thing be thought of that could tend more to the defamation of our Holy Religion and the blessed Author of it, than such an opinion, which would beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, justify the charge of <hi>Celsus</hi> against our Savior, who saith he was <hi>a Magician and a Conjurer?</hi> And <hi>Hierocles</hi> could not be blamed for comparing and preferring <hi>Apollonius</hi> before him.</p>
                  <p>And thus we see what the consequences of that notion are,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62459:186"/> which reduces all faith in Christ, to this single perswasion, that <hi>he is the Messiah;</hi> for this will <hi>either justify,</hi> or at least <hi>excuse</hi> all other apprehensions of him, tho never so false and scandalous. For whether you conceive him God, or only a Man; a Spirit, or as having a Body, and that either real or phantastical; a righteous person or a deceiver, a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or a Magician; it is not much material: for in all the forementioned cases, provided you <hi>hold to this foundation,</hi> you still continue a <hi>true Disciple and brother in Christ.</hi> So that you may deal with your Savior as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did at his arraignment; <hi>you may spit in his face, blindfold and buffet him;</hi> provided at the same time, <hi>you bow the knee and cry Hail O King.</hi> But then you must be sure wisely and well to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between his <hi>personal and political capacity;</hi> if you reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him in the one, tho you despise, or do ay act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight to him in the other, there is no great harm in all that.</p>
                  <p>By all which we see, how by excluding faith out of our schemes and systems of Divinity, the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as to what concerns <hi>the doctrines of it,</hi> is in danger of being destroyed, and betrayed into the hands of those infidels, which for distinction sake, we said might be reckoned within the pale of the Church. For hereby we are made to believe, that all the <hi>errors of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> if they are not inconsistent with piety, <note n="1" place="bottom">All things that are necessary to be believed or known, in the opinion of <hi>Socin.</hi> respect only the precepts or prohibitions of the Gospel. <hi>Id enim iter, quod ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem aeternam sacrae designant literae cognoscendum sufficit.

                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> As this notion gives too great encouragement to our Enemies within the Church, so it affords too great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to those who are without it, I mean <hi>Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> all which will find their account in this notion that confounds <hi>faith with obedience.</hi> And indeed it seems to be but too plainly calculated to undermine all <hi>revealed,</hi> and particularly the authority of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which is chiefly distinguished from all others, by the discovery of certain supernatural truths, and some other duties which are peculiar to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> but which are consequent to, and necessarily dependent upon those truths. For take away the Articles and Mysteries of our Faith, and then tell me what there is in the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> that doth absolutely distinguish it from other Religions, either <hi>Jewish, Mahometan,</hi> or <hi>Pagan;</hi> I mean any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as they stand distinguished from natural Religion. It is true indeed it hath laid aside what (now since our Saviors coming) is superfluous in the <hi>Jewish,</hi> or what was superstitious and impious in the Religion of the <hi>Pagans;</hi> but when those excrescencies are cut off, it seems only (according to this notion) to have reduced things to their primitive state, and that <hi>ancient natural Religion,</hi> which without the assistance of a <hi>supernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> was at first professed and practised in the world.</p>
                  <p>And if so, what such cogent reason can be offered to us, which should necessarily induce us to believe, that our blessed Savior was a messenger sent immediately from God, and his Apostles were divinely inspired, or that the Religion which they published had its Original by a revelation from Heaven; and was not rather the product of bare, but true, right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? For at this rate, they who first published this doctrine, might seem not to need the extraordinary direction of the <hi>spirit of God,</hi> but only of that <hi>spirit within them,</hi> which is the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> which some tell us, is that <hi>light which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man that cometh into the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, that it is true, the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62459:187"/> is nothing else but a <hi>systeme of Morality,</hi> but however, the noblest systeme of Moral precepts, and those required of men in higher degrees, directed by more sublime principles, and enforced with more cogent arguments and motives, than ever yet were offered to the world. Be it so, yet this will not distinguish it in <hi>nature and kind</hi> from natural Religion; it only gives it the preference in point of <hi>degrees of perfection:</hi> which account must necessarily abate much of that reverence and esteem which men hitherto have had for it; who will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be hereby induced to account it but a <hi>mean institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in comparison; as being but the same exactly as to its whole frame and design with <hi>natural religion,</hi> only in some measure more perfect than it. And if so, it can by no means answer the <hi>Elogies and Commendations</hi> which have been given, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently rise up to the height of that <hi>Character</hi> which hath been made, or those <hi>noble Ideas</hi> which have thence been fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it.</p>
                  <p>For that such things should be so long foretold, and such universal hopes thereby be raised in the minds of men; the whole world in a manner, but particularly the nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> being strangely alarumed with the predictions, and by them with the expectation of a mighty person, who was to be sent immediately from God; either as having <hi>Originally been in Heaven,</hi> as we say, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> tell us, who <hi>was to be summoned up thither,</hi> in order to receive particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from God of what he was afterwards to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to the world: And then that all this information; of which so great, so unusual, so universal an expectation was raised, should dwindle into the discovery only of that in which <hi>right reason</hi> had before instructed mankind; or at most of a few additionals to <hi>the great pandect of the Law of nature;</hi> this I say, must needs prove a great disappointment; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently create a disdain and contempt, rather than raise a reverence and esteem for the Faith and the great author and finisher of it.</p>
                  <p>It is certain by this account, our blessed Savior will be put only upon the <hi>same level;</hi> or at best, with some degrees of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62459:187"/> preference, he will hereby be placed only in the same <hi>rank and order of men,</hi> with <hi>Confucius</hi> and <hi>Mongo-Capae,</hi> the two great Apostles of <hi>China and Peru.</hi> To whom, their Disciples will think it no great presumption, to adde <hi>Mahomet and Socinus;</hi> who as they tell us, were raised up on purpose, to restore the worship of the one true God, and to reform those abuses and errors which had corrupted the purity, and defaced the beauty of the ancient and true Religion.</p>
                  <p>In short, if <hi>natural reason,</hi> I mean when it is not stained and sullied with any false and corrupt notions, by its own brightness and splendor is sufficient to inform and instruct us in the <hi>precepts of moral virtue,</hi> and that our happyness depends entirely <note n="1" place="bottom">Let us conclude here and seriously think, that we shall all be judged by Christ at the last day only according to this rule, (<hi>viz.</hi> that body of Christian morality, which he had said just before, makes up the great and whole design of the Gospel) independently on those opinions which make up the subject of our disputes. <hi>An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort. to a free inquiry into the Doctrines of Rel.</hi> p. 15.

                  </p>
                  <p>I know the <hi>Ʋnitarians</hi> sometimes tell us, that sundry of the <hi>precepts of Christ,</hi> but especially <hi>the promises</hi> which are annexed as an encouragment to the practice of them, are of that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime nature, that they surpass the invention of reason; and consequently the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> in that respect is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinguished from <hi>natural,</hi> and the revelation of it is so far useful and necessary.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:62459:188"/>
                  <p>First as to what concerns the <hi>precepts of the Gospel;</hi> it must be acknowledged that sundry of them do indeed exceed the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of bare reason tho never so bright and defecate: but then I say they are such as depend upon the knowledge of the necessary and fundamental articles of our faith, (such as are the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption of the world</hi> by the sufferings of our Savior) and without which knowledge they cannot be performed; as I shall shew by and by. But for these duties our adversaries are not concerned; and indeed it is impossible they should: except at the same time they would acknowledge the doctrine of <hi>our Saviors Mediation</hi> as it is stated and received in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which is the great and fundamental prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our <hi>Christian duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The precepts</hi> therefore which they contend for (except it be that one which concerns the <hi>invocation and worship of Christ,</hi> about which they themselves are divided) are only those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>charity, truth, righteousness, temperance,</hi> together with those other <hi>moral virtues,</hi> which as I said before, they comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general name of <hi>probity.</hi> Now as to these and all other the duties of Religion, which have no relation to the articles and mysteries of our faith, it may reasonably be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any precept of the Gospel, which hath not been discovered by the <hi>light of nature</hi> and approved and recommended as <hi>agreeable to reason,</hi> tho perhaps not strictly and peremptorily prescribed under the <hi>notion and obligation of a law.</hi> I say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps: tho some of our <hi>modern Ʋnitarians</hi> have expressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without that caution and reservedness, and have been positive in it; telling us <hi>that whatever additions have been made by our Savior to the</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>2dly,</hi> As to what concerns the <hi>promises of the Gospel,</hi> and particularly the promise of eternal life, we know the belief of this in general hath prevailed among men of all Sects and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, tho in point of clearness and manifestation, the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> hath the advantage above all other institutions: not only above the <hi>Mahometan and Pagan,</hi> where the knowledge of a future life hath been depraved by many profane and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious mixtures; but likewise above <hi>pure natural,</hi> and even the <hi>Jewish Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But tho this shews us <hi>the excellence,</hi> it doth not prove <hi>the necessity</hi> of the Christian Religion, according to the <hi>Socinians.</hi> For the only things which the Gospel discovers worthy our notice, are <hi>the precepts</hi> and the <hi>promises</hi> which it contains. <hi>The precepts,</hi> they say, are the same with those of natural religion. And as to what concerns the <hi>promises,</hi> we need only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <note n="1" place="bottom">Let it not be said that the happiness which these Philosophers speak of (<hi>viz. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal, Arist. Sen. Cic. &amp;c.</hi>) relates only to this life, and that they had not that prospect of a future felicity which animates us Christians to our duty.

                  <p>And thus this account of <hi>Socinus,</hi> instead of advancing the reputation, and convincing us of the necessity of the Christian doctrine, plainly encourages <hi>an indifference</hi> in all religions: upon which account we find him and his disciples in their writings speaking very favorably of <hi>Mahometans, Jews, and Pagans.</hi>

                     </note>
                     <hi>after all these advantages we must return to our first principles; and the law of nature is the foundation of all Christs instructions, so that nothing is revealed in the Gospel but what arises from that law and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62459:189"/> is built upon it.</hi> Agreeable to what is thus affirmed by this Author, we find another <hi>Ʋnitarian,</hi> in his <hi>Impartial account of the word Mystery,</hi> assigning the ends and reasons why any Religion was revealed to mankind; and what the intent of the Holy Ghost was in that revelation, which he reduces to these two heads. <hi>1st, It was given us,</hi> he saith, <hi>to excite and preserve among men the natural principles of Morality and Religion, which nature or the universal Tradition had engrafted in their hearts.</hi> 2dly, <hi>It was given to abridge our studies and enquiries, by making easy to us the knowledge of our happyness, and the means whereby we may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attain it. Philosophers might have clearer notions about this point than simple men, but they must arrive at it by long reasonings. Thus by the light of nature and the art of reasoning, men might arrive at the knowledge of the goodness, justice, and power of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding just men: nay from Gods general promises, one might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by several consequences the particular reward of the resurrection of the dead. But since revelation hath made those truths common to those who cannot reach to an exact reasoning, the meanest men have as much knowledge about this matter, as the most learned can have. p.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>So that in the Revelation which the Gospel affords us of the truths which concern our Salvation, God seems princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to have consulted the benefit of the weak and illiterate, of which the bulk of mankind is composed, who may now by the help of that <hi>clear Revelation</hi> afforded them, at first view behold those great truths, which otherwise would require Learning and Philosophy to inform them of; and all men are not fitted for such learned and laborious deductions. But when all is done, according to his opinion, <hi>Revelation</hi> instructs us in no <hi>new truths,</hi> which <hi>reason</hi> could not inform us of: only the former brings us in a more compendious way to the knowledge of our duty, and our happiness; which the latter conducts men to, as certainly, but with more leisure, and by going farther about.</p>
                  <p>Lastly as to <hi>the Jews</hi> tho' there may be some difficulties which attend the case of these men, above that of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Mahometans and Pagans;</hi> because they are not ignorant of Christ, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> are; nor do they only deny him
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62459:190"/> to be the Son of God, with the <hi>Mahometans;</hi> but account him to be a <hi>false Prophet and an Impostor,</hi> whilst the former make an honorable mention of him as of a <hi>great Prophet, and the word and breath of God:</hi> yet for all this there is no reason why we should renounce their fellowship and communion. For as long as they embrace and practise the precepts of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which as we observed before, are but the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with the Laws of the two Tables; and believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of eternal life, and are animated to obedience by that faith; they know and do, all that is necessary either <hi>for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or practice.</hi> And therefore, for all their disowning and denyal of our Savior, they may still be accounted <hi>true believers,</hi> and the <hi>Disciples of the Messias,</hi> as well as the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> who are sometime willing to be esteemed such, as we heard before.

                  <p>In the next place I am to shew, that this position is not only destructive of the <hi>Christian doctrine,</hi> but likewise of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an practice,</hi> having a very malignant influence even upon <hi>that,</hi> which our adversaries seem to be so much concerned for, <hi>viz. pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And here first I think, I may take it for granted, that the great end which God proposed to himself in the first creating,

                     </note> act of Religion, and indeed the foundation of all the rest, consists in our <hi>acknowledgment of his being,</hi> and in having just and honorable conceptions of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite nature, and adorable perfections. And this will necessarily produce such actions in our minds, as are suitable and agreeable thereunto. That is, the consideration of <hi>his infinite power, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, truth, goodness and justice, &amp;c.</hi> will dispose us <hi>to love, reverence and adore him; to believe him, to place our hopes, trust, and confidence in him;</hi> to submit to his authority, to fear his displeasure, and in every thing to comply with his will, by what way soever that comes to be made known to us, whether by natural reason, or supernatural revelation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly,</hi> That the exercise of Religion consists not only in the <hi>internal acts</hi> of <hi>hope, love, faith,</hi> and <hi>admiration;</hi> but likewise in the <hi>external expressions</hi> of those inward motions and dispositions of the mind, and particularly in those actions which make up that which is properly called <hi>the worship of God,</hi> such as are <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>praise, &amp;c.</hi> which have him immediately for their object; and thereby are distinguished from those other acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which more directly relate to, and are conversant about <hi>our neighbors</hi> or <hi>our selves. 5thly,</hi> That God almighty best knows what kind of <hi>service and worship</hi> is most agreeable to his own nature and perfections; what most conduces to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great ends of his own glory, and the happiness of mankind, and consequently is most acceptable to him. For this reason it is highly fititng that we should observe <hi>his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,</hi> and govern our selves by <hi>his directions</hi> in this affair.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62459:194"/> And for want of this observation and regard had to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of God almighty, with relation to his worship, men have run into innumerable, and endless extravagancies. For when they once put their <hi>own reason</hi> in opposition to <hi>his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wisdome,</hi> or their own <hi>humors and fancies,</hi> to the plain and open declarations <hi>of his will and pleasure;</hi> no man can tell how far, and whither they may wander; and into what desperate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and mistakes they may plunge, and out of which it will be no easy matter to recover themselves; as the experience of all ages informs us.</p>
                  <p>Now in this is founded the reasonableness and necessity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>positive institutions of Christ,</hi> as well as those <hi>moral precepts</hi> of the Gospel, in the obedience to which our <hi>Ʋnitarians</hi> would have all religion to consist. <hi>The light of nature</hi> hath directed mankind, and informed them of certain duties which are of <hi>universal, necessary and indispensable obligation.</hi> But besides these <hi>revelation</hi> hath discovered, and superadded some new ones to the observance of which (since we are assured that they are the results of the divine will and pleasure) we should in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in all good Conscience (if we make any Conscience of the service of God) think our selves strictly obliged. And therefore they who place all Religion, as we intimated before, in the practice of the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> and neglect the <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties of Religion,</hi> instead of bringing <hi>glory to God,</hi> which is as we said, the great design of Religion, they <hi>really dishonor him▪</hi> by despising and affronting his authority, and therefore may justly expect to find the effects. of his displeasure for so doing.</p>
                  <p>We see how God of old guarded his own institutions (his positive ones I mean) with very <hi>severe sanctions,</hi> which were as <hi>severely executed,</hi> upon such who presumed to violate them. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the punishment that overtook <hi>Adam,</hi> and which still pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues all his posterity for his disobedience to <hi>one positive precept given him in Paradise▪</hi> And in the <hi>Jewish Oeconomy,</hi> we find the violations of the Law, even in some small and inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble instances, as we may imagin, were punished with unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rigor. As in the case of the man <hi>who gathered a few sticks on
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62459:194"/> the Sabbath day;</hi> who, for so doing was by the particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, <hi>stoned to death,</hi> Numb. 15. 35. <hi>And Nadab and Abihu, only for offering strange fire, i. e.</hi> such as was not taken from the Altar, <hi>were themselves consumed by fire from Heaven,</hi> Lev. 10. 2. To omit other instances.</p>
                  <p>By which it appears, <hi>how jealous God is of his honor,</hi> how <hi>tender of his authority,</hi> whatever slight apprehensions we may have of them. And if this were duely thought on and weighed as it ought, it would be a good means to stop the mouths, and silence the cavils of those gainsayers, who in former and later times, with most detestable pride and presumption, have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned the wisdom of God, have censured and condemned his proceedings with men in relation to his <hi>positive Laws</hi> and <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi> For did they but seriously consider the <hi>supereminent and incomprehensible greatness of God,</hi> and their <hi>own despicable meanness,</hi> and thereupon reflect upon the infinite distance between both, sure they durst not propose so many bold and impious questions, relating to his dispensations with men, as have sometimes drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the mouths and pens of these impertinent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Scoffers,</p>
                  <p>They ought to believe, that all his actions and dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are conducted by <hi>an infinite and unerring wisdome,</hi> tho he doth not always think fit to acquaint us with the <hi>ends and reasons</hi> of them. And as they ought to <hi>admire his wisdome,</hi> so ought they likewise to have a <hi>due regard to his authority;</hi> which is seen in all his commands, all his orders and appointments. Of which when we are once assured that they have him for their author, <hi>nobis solum obsequii gloria relicta est,</hi> we have nothing to do but to shew our subjection by a dutiful complyance. For tho the <hi>particular matter</hi> to which our obedience is required should be really small and inconsiderable; yet <hi>the authority</hi> of God is no such <hi>despicable thing,</hi> nor consequently is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which we are to pay to it an <hi>indifferent matter:</hi> As God by many and terrible examples hath declared, especially in his dealings with the <hi>Jews,</hi> threatening <hi>death and excision</hi> to the violaters even of the ritual and Ceremonial part of his Religion. And the like consideration ought to extend it self
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62459:195"/> to the <hi>institutions of the Gospel,</hi> such as are the <hi>Ministry, Sacraments, Church Assemblies,</hi> and <hi>Discipline, the observation of the Lords day</hi> &amp;c. All which ought to be regarded by us with that respect and reverence, which is due to the authority of him, from whom they had their Original.</p>
                  <p>It is not enough therefore for any man to say that he will serve God, but it shall <hi>be in his own way.</hi> That he is content indeed to pray to God, and praise him; but he will take his own time, and make use of his own methods, and in short in all the acts of religion he will govern himself by his own <hi>humor or judgment</hi> call it which you will. No, say I, if he will serve God, he must do it in <hi>Gods way,</hi> if he expects that that service should be acceptable to him. It is true if a man hath no <hi>other light</hi> to conduct him but his <hi>own reason,</hi> he must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that and be governed by it. But on the other hand he who hath a better and brighter light afforded him, to wit, that <hi>of prophesy and revelation,</hi> must give himself up to the guidance and direction of it: and this he is obliged to do both in point of gratitude and prudence. otherwise if any man shall pretend to follow the <hi>dictates of his fancy or his reason,</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>the mind and pleasure of God</hi> discovered and revealed to him: all that service which proceeds from thence, tho' it may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the appearance of piety and probity and I know not what, yet will really be no better than a sort of <hi>will-worship,</hi> and such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will be no <hi>reasonable service,</hi> whatever other appearance of sobriety and wisdom it may carry along with it.</p>
                  <p>For is it not highly reasonable to allow, that he who is the Author and fountain of all graces and blessings should make choice of <hi>his own way</hi> of dispensing them? If therefore he hath appointed the <hi>preaching of the word</hi> and <hi>administration of the Sacraments</hi> to be the way and means of conveying grace: ought we then to attend those ordinances to which the grace and blessing is annexed? And tho as the case stands we are able to give a good account of the end and reasons of these institutions: yet if we knew of no other than the bare command of God, that of it self should be a sufficient reason to engage our compliance. He can accomplish the <hi>greatest
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62459:195"/> things</hi> by the most <hi>unlikely means,</hi> and oftentimes makes choice of such, to manifest his <hi>own power and wisdom</hi> thereby: that he may have all the glory, to whom of right it belongs; and that we may be taught to live in an absolute submission to, and an entire dependance upon him.</p>
                  <p>As to some particular circumstances relating to the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of these holy offices, my present design doth not lead me to speak any thing of them: my business being principally with such who reject, or undervalue all established <hi>order, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, institutions,</hi> and make it their employment to bring the priesthood together with all those other offices which belong to that holy function into contempt; chiefly influenced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by that pernicious principle, that all Religion consists only in <hi>the practice of virtue and morality;</hi> which is a prevailing notion among too many, and the great occasion of so many disorders in the lives of men, which at this day are too visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by which at long run, all Religion, even natural, may be in danger of being overturned, and all morality ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished likewise into the bargain; notwithstanding the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and pretences that may be made to advance it.</p>
                  <p>6ly. That God hath not only informed us of the <hi>material</hi> but likewise of the <hi>formal parts</hi> of our duty; that is, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>substance,</hi> but likewise of those <hi>principles and motives</hi> which must be the main springs of our actions; and likewise of <hi>the end</hi> to which they are to be directed. And these are as necessary to be regarded as the former; because if we should practise the duty as to the matter of it, and yet omit the right manner of the performance, such actions tho' they might be esteemed moral virtues, yet would not be acts of Religion. For every action of Religion must be done with respect to Gods authority, and must be directed to his glory. This is essential to the notion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have proceeded by such steps, in which we may reasonably expect the concurrence of all who own a revealed Religion. But I must rise one degree higher, and therefore must affirm in the <hi>7th</hi> place that as some of the duties of the Christian Religion indispensably required of us, even as to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62459:196"/>
                     <hi>the substance and matter</hi> of them cannot be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of the doctrines of it: (such as are the invocation and worship of Christ, either as to the <hi>internal acts</hi> of hope, love, dependance, submission to him, or as to the <hi>external expressions</hi> of those acts by prayer, praise, &amp;c. all which do necessarily suppose his Divinity, as was said and proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and need not to be repeated again) so none of them can be practised in <hi>a right manner</hi> without the like knowledge of the abovenamed doctrines and mysteries; <hi>the belief</hi> of which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to influence a Christians life and practice. And this will appear from a consideration of those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which are requisite to <hi>constitute and specify</hi> the acts of Religion, so as to make them truly <hi>Christian duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>1st.</hi> as to the <hi>efficient cause,</hi> they must proceed from a higher principle than <hi>bare nature and reason,</hi> to wit, from the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and the operations of his blessed Spirit; without whose assistance we cannot perform any <hi>saving good.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this is plain, because our natures in themselves are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and all our faculties depraved: so that no good thing, I mean that is perfectly so, can proceed from them, till they are sanctifyed and renewed: <hi>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> In short whatever actions do not flow from a love of God, a reverential deference to his authority, a firm lively faith and relyance upon his wisdom, power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: however good and laudable they may otherwise as to the substance and matter of them be, they cannot be pleasing to God, nor will be accepted of, or rewarded by him. For <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith,</hi> and the like we may say of the love, and fear of God, <hi>it is impossible to please him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these and all other the like divine dispositions, being above the power of nature, (and therefore by the Christian Church have always been accounted <hi>supernatural,</hi> not only with respect to <hi>the end</hi> to which they are ordained and directed, but likewise with respect to <hi>the principle</hi> from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) must be implanted in us by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who is the fountain of all holyness: and without whose special aid we cannot perform any such good, as I said before, as will entitle
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62459:196"/> us to the favor of God and eternal life. For <hi>whatever is born of the flesh is flesh,</hi> 3. Jo. 6. what hath no higher principle than bare nature, tho' never so much exalted by the improvements of reason and philosophy, is but <hi>natural;</hi> but <hi>what is born of the spirit is spirit.</hi> A divine seed there must be before we can be <hi>born of God,</hi> and none that is not thus <hi>born of water and the spirit of God, can enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> In a word, <hi>they who are led by the spirit of God, they</hi> only <hi>are the sons of God,</hi> 8. Rom. 14. And <hi>they who have not the spirit of Christ, are none of his,</hi> 9. v.</p>
                  <p>Now this circumstance of Christian duty, and without which it cannot <hi>be Christian,</hi> doth necessarily suppose the belief and acknowledgment of this important article concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I know the case of some <hi>virtuous Heathens</hi> and others, will be brought in opposition to what is thus said, who tho they had no knowledge of this holy spirit, yet were renowned for their probity, justice, and other virtues, which did adorn their natures, and shine forth in their conversations. But yet for all this we must say, that in all their most celebrated actions, there were certain not only <hi>gradual,</hi> but <hi>essential defects;</hi> and particularly they were deficient in the <hi>cause and principle</hi> from whence they did proceed; as not flowing from that perfect love and that <hi>faith without which itis impossible to please God.</hi> For which reason their brightest virtues, and the actions which flowed from them were by St. <hi>Austin</hi> stiled <hi>splendida peccata:</hi> which tho by many hath been judged too harsh and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table an expression: yet upon due enquiry it will be found such as may be justifyed both from scripture and reason.</p>
                  <p>For, since <hi>bonum est ex integra causa, malum ex quolibet defectu;</hi> there being in all the most laudable actions of such infidels as we are now speaking of, a deficience as to <hi>the principle</hi> from whence they flow: they cannot therefore but be destitute of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62459:197"/> that <hi>essential perfection,</hi> which is necessary to render them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. They do not proceed from <hi>that faith,</hi> which alone can enable us <hi>to overcome the world.</hi> And this is fully acknowledged by <note n="1" place="bottom">Quis est qui vincit mundum, nisi qui credit Jesum esse Christum? <hi>quasi dicat Apostolus: circumspicite &amp; lustrate universum mundum, &amp; ostendite mihi vel unum de quo vere affirmari possit, quod mundum vincat vel vicerit qui Christianus &amp; fide hac praeditus non sit.

                     <hi>Episcopius</hi> himself: who tho otherwise he had as litle favor for the doctrines of St. <hi>Austin</hi> as most men, and as favorable an opinion of the virtuous Heathens as their case would bear; yet by the plain declarations of Scripture, and the evidence of truth arising from thence, he was forced to acknowledge as much in this case as St. <hi>Austin</hi> or any of the <hi>other Fathers</hi> did who were concerned in opposing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the errors of <hi>Pelagius;</hi> among which the principal was, that men by the strength of nature could perform <hi>bonum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutare,</hi> that which is a saving good, <hi>without the assistance of the spirit of God:</hi> which together with the other opinions of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> have been picked up by <hi>Socinus</hi> and incorporated into his <hi>divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:62459:197"/>
                  <p>But whatsoever may be the case of those <hi>virtuous Heathens,</hi> and others, who have no knowledge of the spirit of God: and whatever allowances the God of all compassion may make them, <hi>besides and beyond any promise or covenant,</hi> (of which we have no information in the Scriptures, and therefore to <hi>the extraordinary and uncovenanted mercy</hi> of him we must leave them, whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is beyond our conceptions and over all his works;) yet I know no excuse can be framed for those who after plain and clear information, are so far from making their addresses to God for <note n="1" place="bottom">See the <hi>discourse concerning human reason,</hi> before cited, together with that called the <hi>Trinitarian scheme of religion, with the notes upon it:</hi> where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, with his usual buffoonry endeavors to expose the Catholick doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impotence of mans nature (in this degenerate state) to perform any saving good, without the help and assistance of Gods grace. This he represents as an impious, and withall as a foolish, absurd, ridiculous opinion. And upon <hi>the head concerning the Sacraments,</hi> he not only denies that grace, which all good Christians say is annexed to the due use of them, but in a blasphemous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he accounts it no better than charm and incantation. p. 23. 24.</note> assistance, that they only fall down before that Divinity which is in them, their <hi>reason</hi> forsooth; to whom all their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are made. This is the <hi>light that enlightens,</hi> this the <hi>spirit that animates them.</hi> But as for any grace or help from above, this they neither want, nor are concerned for.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle tells us as we heard before, <hi>that as many as are led by the spirit of God,</hi> they <hi>only</hi> are the Sons of God. But that this spirit, should <hi>direct, counsel, govern</hi> such who are so far from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring his aid, (which yet is the necessary condition of obtaining it, as our Savior hath assured us) that they reject and deride it; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reasonably be imagined. I wish things may be found other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the conclusion, and that this blessed spirit may by his mighty power sanctify and save these men, if it be possible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no. But I am sure they have great reason to think themselves in extream danger; and to suspect that pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and probity for which they have been so much celebrated and admired. For if it do not proceed from the <hi>true cause,</hi> it will be deficient in one of those circumstances which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to render it acceptable to God. For in short; <hi>If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his,</hi> 8. Rom. 9. and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:62459:198"/> whether they can be <hi>led by that spirit,</hi> who blaspheme his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and not only refuse his assistance, but scoff at, ridicule and deride it, will become them seriously and timely to consider.</p>
                  <p>A second circumstance requisite to constitute an action of religion a Christian duty, <hi>is the end</hi> to which it is to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which is now not only the glory of God in general; but the glory of <hi>the blessed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> For it is not the <hi>Godhead</hi> barely considered in it self, or as residing in one single person, but as subsisting in the before-mentioned <hi>three glorious persons,</hi> which to us Christians is the true object of Religious adoration and worship. By the profession and faith of <hi>this Trinity</hi> are we admitted members of Christs Church; to their service are we solemnly devoted by baptisme, and to their honor all our actions should be referred; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are not actions of <hi>Christian duty,</hi> nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will they be accepted of or rewarded as such. <hi>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,</hi> let his pretensions be what they will, Jo. 5. 23. nay all men are <hi>to honor the Son</hi> even <hi>as they honor the Father,</hi> with the <hi>same religious worship;</hi> which yet they cannot, they must not exhibit to him, if he be <hi>not God</hi> as well as <hi>man.</hi> Otherwise that worship would be <hi>plain Idolatry,</hi> as we have shewn before, so that the belief of the <hi>holy Trinity,</hi> is absolutely necessary to influence a Christians practice.</p>
                  <p>Lastly <hi>the manner</hi> after which our duties are to be performed, requires the like knowledge and belief. For they are all to have a necessary relation to <hi>the mediation</hi> of our Savior, which is the great and fundamental principle of a Christian life and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. It is not enough for us to offer up our praises to God for the works of <hi>creation and providence,</hi> but we must do it chiefly for that stupendous contrivance of his wisdom, in <hi>the redemption and salvation of mankind.</hi> It is not enough to cast our selves at the feet of our offended Creator, and to implore his mercy for the pardon of our sins; but we must beg it <hi>in the name</hi> and by <hi>the mediation</hi> of his Son. It is not enough to forgive our enemies, but we must do it chiefly for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>that God for Christs sake hath forgiven us.</hi> We must be chast
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:62459:198"/> and temperate; but the motives to these duties must not be taken either solely or chiefly from the consideration of our neighbors or our selves; but from the remembrance <hi>that we are bought with a price: that we are not our own, and therefore should glorify God with our bodies and spirits which are his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In short all our duties must be performed by the assistance of his spirit, all our services sanctifyed by his grace, and the defects of them pardoned by his merits. Our garments must be washed in his blood; our prayers and praises must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed by his incense, being then only gratefull to his father, when presented to him, by the gracious and powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of his Son. In one word, even <hi>charity which is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law,</hi> and to which the Apostle gives the preference above faith, must yet be influenced by it, otherwise we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly love God, nor expect to be beloved by him. For the great motive to our love of God, must be that amazing instance of his love <hi>in sending his Son into the world,</hi> first to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us in our duty, and then to die for us.</p>
                  <p>How his Son? Was he only <hi>an adopted Son,</hi> a good man, who was honoured with that style; because he was <hi>sanctifyed and sent into the world,</hi> in order to discover the will of God to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and afterwards laid down his life in confirmation of the truth of what he so delivered? What was there so great, so strange, so unusual in this that heaven and earth should stand astonished at it; that the Angels should <hi>stoop down</hi> and pry and peep into this mystery? Surely there must be something more in this affair, or else the whole world could not be filled with wonder and amazement at it. Indeed there was somewhat extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary: for God <hi>so loved the world that he sent his only begotten Son,</hi> (a title never assumed, never given to any the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creature) into it, <hi>that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> This consideration surely must be able to work upon our affections, and if that cannot, it must be absolutely impossible that any other motive or argument should prevail.</p>
                  <p>By all which we see, that all the actions of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life must be influenced by, and one way or other have
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62459:199"/> relation to <hi>the mediation of our Savior;</hi> and this mediation must receive its virtue and efficacy <hi>from the divinity of his person,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could never have performed the functions and operations which belong to that high office, as hath been shewn at large in the foregoing papers.</p>
                  <p>So that indeed, the belief of this single article concerning <hi>the Divinity</hi> of our Savior, is so far from being an indifferent matter, as some would perswade us, that it is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the very <hi>Being and Essence of the Christian Religion:</hi> and the denyal of it consequently must unavoidably occasion a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental change in the whole frame and constitution of it. So that a Religion with this doctrine, and another without it, are two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions of <hi>a different species,</hi> between which there must be a vast and an irreconcilable disagreement: forasmuch as they cannot agree either in proposing the same <hi>articles to be believed,</hi> or recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same <hi>duties to be practised</hi> by their respective professors.</p>
                  <p>For let the divinity of Christ be discarded, then you must be content to part with all the other doctrines concerning the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption</hi> of the world by the merits and satisfaction of our Savior. The like change will attend the doctrines concerning the Ministry and the Sacraments, both as to their <hi>nature, use, and efficacy.</hi> The whole covenant <hi>of grace</hi> will hereby be entirely changed: because there cannot be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same <hi>promises on one hand,</hi> or the same <hi>conditions</hi> to be performed on the other, as are now supposed. And thus the alteration of the faith will necessarily be attended with an alteration in the practice of Christians. Our prayers and praises must be different: we cannot have the <hi>same faith,</hi> nor the <hi>same hope,</hi> nor exercise the <hi>same charity.</hi> For these duties, (and the like must be affirmed of all other graces,) in them that believe, and in those who deny the divinity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior must flow from different principles, must be influenced by different motives, and must be directed to different ends, and consequently occasion an essential change in those duties. In short upon the belief and profession of this doctrine <hi>Christ hath built his Church:</hi> and upon the same foundation we must build our <hi>comforts and our hopes,</hi> and there we shall find a sure bottom for them to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62459:199"/> rest on, <hi>against which the powers of hell shall not be able to prevail.</hi> And from this <hi>confidence nothing I hope shall be able to withdraw us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have shewn how this opinion which denies the necessity of faith, plainly subverts the Christian Religion both as <hi>to doctrine and practice:</hi> which is the second pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence that flows from it.</p>
                  <p>The third and last evil consequence that attends this position is, that it is <hi>highly dishonourable to the holy Scriptures,</hi> and tends <hi>directly</hi> to weaken that esteem and reverence which we should have for them. For as I observed in the beginning of this discourse, <hi>faith</hi> can for no other reason be thought unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but because <hi>the objects</hi> about which it is conversant are of no great importance. If the doctrines revealed in Scripture be such as that the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>salvation of mens souls</hi> are concerned in them, then it is certain the knowledge of them cannot be judged an indifferent matter. But if it be said that those truths contained there are of that nature, as that the honor of God, and our own safety do not depend upon them; then the question that must arise hence will be, to what purpose were they discovered? and why do the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themselves lay such a stress upon that discovery, as to tell us, that they were <hi>mysteries, great mysteries, hid from former ages,</hi> and now <hi>revealed by the spirit of God,</hi> who only could find out and fathom <hi>these deep things,</hi> which he hath made known to the world? nay the <hi>Son of God who lay in the bosome of his Father,</hi> thought it worth while to come down into the world on purpose, to discover those secrets which otherwise must for ever have lain concealed there.</p>
                  <p>And after all this, are these such trifling inconsiderable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that it is of no great consequence whether we know or are ignorant of them? whether we believe or whether we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them? Can any thing be uttered that can tend more to the defamation of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and the <hi>Authors and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of them? For if the Socinian account of these things be true, then I say it must cast a dangerous reflexion upon the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62459:200"/>
                     <hi>wisdom and integrity</hi> of those divine writers which is hereby brought under a just suspicion: in that they should in such a grave and serious manner deliver what they had to say, under the notion of <hi>supernatural, important, sublime truths,</hi> which when they come to be narrowly examined, are found to be of such little use and benefit to mankind. Nay the reflexion must rise higher, and be terminated on the spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who is said to have <hi>assisted, directed, and inspired them</hi> with the knowledge of those truths, which they afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing for the lasting benefit of the Church to all succeeding ages of the world.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be said, there are some things contained in the Scriptures of great importance to the souls of men; but these are only <hi>the precepts,</hi> and those <hi>promises</hi> by which we are encouraged to yield obedience to them. But for the rest, they are useless, or at best indifferent matters, which we may either know or be ignorant of, without running any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard thereby. I answer, since the precepts and promises make up but a part of the writings, particularly of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we are now chiefly speaking of, the other which is the greatest part of them must still lie under the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned reflexion, which cannot be wiped off by this answer.</p>
                  <p>First, for the Gospels, we know they are in great measure made up of the account which is there given of the birth, life actions, miracles, passion, death, resurrection, ascension of our Savior; all which were carefully recorded by the Evangelists, with this design that we might be informed of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be induced to <hi>believe that he was the Son of God, and that by believing we might have life thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:62459:200"/>

                  <p>And <hi>2dly,</hi> if besides the <hi>history</hi> we consider <hi>the doctrine</hi> which is recorded in the Gospel, (if we may be allowed thus to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And our Savior himself, besides the instructions which he gives his hearers, for the regulating and government of their life and actions, is copious in giving an account of himself as to his <hi>nature, descent, and original;</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Then for the <hi>Epistles;</hi> whether those that are styled <hi>general,</hi> or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se wrote upon more <hi>particular occasions,</hi> as directed to certain persons or churches; but which as to their use are likewise gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and designed for the lasting benefit of the Church to all succeeding ages: I say in these we find the Apostles frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earnestly inculcating and recommending the <hi>doctrine</hi> as well as <hi>practice</hi> of Christianity: their business was to make their disciples and converts, not only <hi>good men,</hi> but likewise <hi>sound believers.</hi> To confirm and settle them in <hi>the faith,</hi> to guard them against those errors and heresies, which very early be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to corrupt the purity of the Christian doctrine: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which errors, and of that degeneracy of manners, and impurity of life, which is first or last the constant and inevitable consequence of such errors, (I mean which strike at the foundations of Religion) <hi>the way of truth was evil spoken of▪</hi> To mention all particulars would be in a manner to transcribe the Epistles. I shall therefore content my self with what may be found in the directions given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:62459:201"/> and <hi>Titus,</hi> the Bishops and Metropolitans of <hi>Ephosus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these we find our Apostle had a particular and especial regard to the <hi>faith and doctrine</hi> as well as <hi>precepts and practice</hi> of the Christian Religion. He requires <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believers in word</hi> as well <hi>as conversation, in faith</hi> as well as <hi>purity,</hi> 1. <hi>Ep. Tim.</hi> 4. chap. 12. In order to his being <hi>a good minister of Jesus Christ,</hi> it was requisite that he should be <hi>nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the words of faith and of good doctrine,</hi> v. v. <hi>That he should give attendance to doctrine,</hi> 13. v. and to <hi>that gift which was in him,</hi> 14. viz. his high function and office, together with those gifts of knowledge and wisdom in the mysteries of his holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whereby he was enabled to discharge it. He was to <hi>take heed to himself,</hi> and particularly <hi>to his doctrine, for in so doing he should both save himself and them that heard him</hi> 16. v.</p>
                  <p>How by so doing <hi>save himself?</hi> doth the salvation of men depend upon their holding and maintaining sound doctrine? why I thought this had been a matter of speculation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Religion was not much concerned in it: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists <hi>wholly and solely</hi> in the practice of virtue and morality. <hi>Socinus</hi> indeed and his friends have told us so: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> we find was of another opinion. And therefore he once and again exhorts his Son <hi>Timothy, to hold fast the form of sound words, in faith</hi> as well as <hi>in love,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. which latter is the effect and fruit of the former, and therefore both are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and maintained. <hi>we must hold faith and a good conscience,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. the observation of all ages assuring us that it is seldom found, but that they who cast away one, do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise make shipwrack of the other. And therefore a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> and a <hi>faith unfeigned</hi> are again joined together by the Apost. v. 5. of this ch.</p>
                  <p>The like advice is given <hi>Titus,</hi> that he should not only shew himself <hi>a pattern to his flock, in good works,</hi> but likewise that he should <hi>in doctrine shew uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with sound speech which cannot be condemned, 2. Tit.</hi> 7. 8. v. And in the qualifications of a Bishop mentioned in the 1. ch. it is required not only that he should be <hi>sober, just, holy, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> &amp;c. but likewise that he should <hi>hold fast the faithfull word,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:62459:201"/> that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saiers, ver.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> delivers himself: but if what <hi>Socinus</hi> saith be true; we shall find that he hath taken a great deal of pains to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and hath shewn, perhaps <hi>a well meant,</hi> but an <hi>ignorant and mistaken zeal</hi> in these his writings; and that both with relation to the sound doctrine which he upon all occasions recommends, and <hi>2dly,</hi> the errors which are opposite to it.</p>
                  <p>1<hi>st,</hi> As to <hi>matters of faith and doctrine,</hi> it is certain our Apostle hath shewn a great concern, and hath used abundance of zeal and vehemence in recommending that which in the conclusion, if, as I said, we believe <hi>Socinus,</hi> will be found to be of very small consequence, and in which Religion is little or not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. This knowledge and perswasion of the mind may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make us be esteemed and magnifyed by men, but it will not render us acceptable to God, who puts no value upon any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>the understanding;</hi> and is only concerned for <hi>matters of practice,</hi> and those duties <hi>of morality</hi> which make up a good life.</p>
                  <p>It is true the former without this latter will be really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant; but in conjunction with it, it is of necessary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable obligation, in the opinion of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> I confess if this <hi>Socinian</hi> Position which we are now refuting be true, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was certainly under a mistake. He advised <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>take care of his doctrine</hi> and to <hi>hold fast the form of sound words,</hi> but he ought rather to have said, be an example <hi>in conversation and charity,</hi> but do not trouble thy hearers with discourses about Faith. Take heed to <hi>thy life,</hi> and then it is no matter what becomes of <hi>thy doctrine. Obedi &amp; credidisti,</hi> true faith consists in obedience, and a good life is the end of all Religion, as hath been often said, and if that be attained, we have made sufficient provision for Gods glory and our own safety, and therefore need not disturb our selves or others about matters of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>speculation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this may seem fine and plausible at first view, and may carry the appearance of truth to men of shallow understandings, or to others who tho they are not of such weak minds, yet for some reasons may be willing enough to be deceived, but can never prevail with any who are througly conversant in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:62459:202"/> Holy Scriptures, and have any true sense of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as it is laid down and described there. What man is there who hath any right tast and relish of those <hi>weighty, solid, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial truths</hi> which the sacred writings recommends to us, who can be content to exchange them for those <hi>thin, aery superficial discourses of morality</hi> which are to be found in the writings of our Adversaries.</p>
                  <p>It is true these latter, (as we have allways said, and must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still to say, upon this and the like occasions) I mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and precepts to <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>morality,</hi> ought to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to with a particular regard. They are <hi>incorporated</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Holy Religion, and make up a <hi>principal part</hi> of it, and without them all other pretences to Religion, <hi>are hypocritical and vain.</hi> But yet this must not be construed to the prejudice of that other part of Religion which consists in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of those supernatural truths revealed in the Scriptures, <hi>which are worthy of all acceptation:</hi> and therefore should be received by us with all thankfulness, and entertained with all reverence, attention and esteem. Particularly St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his writings is still entertaining his readers with discourses about the faith, and with high elogies and commendations of it, chiefly upon this score, that the objects and articles of it are <hi>Mysteries,</hi> above the reach and comprehension of reason, as hath formerly been observed.</p>
                  <p>What doth this <hi>Mysteriophilus</hi> mean, may some of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries say, thus to trouble and perplex our understandings with such sublime and incomprehensible matters? Wherever we look into his Epistles we still meet with Mysteries and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and are perpetually pursued and haunted as it were by them at every turn. It is true, the <hi>writings of St. Paul</hi> are full of such sublime truths and doctrines, and except we are resolved to lay these writings quite aside, those <hi>mysterious truths</hi> like so many <hi>phantomes</hi> will still be presenting themselves to our view, notwithstanding the attempts which some men have made, <hi>by reason and sound sense,</hi> as they call it, to <hi>chase them away from their habitations.</hi> But notwithstanding all their endeavors, and the success that either hath, or may attend such attempts, yet
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62459:202"/> they will never totally prevail, as long as we can preserve our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:</hi> our <hi>Bibles</hi> I say, which we still appeal to, and by which we are content all matters in dispute between us should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. For let them chase these truths where they please, and let them with never so much scorn and disdain discard them out of their new <hi>Schemes and Systems of Divinity;</hi> yet they can never drive them out of <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> nor particularly the <hi>writings of St. Paul,</hi> and there we shall be sure to find them.</p>
                  <p>But some men tho they are content to be accounted <hi>Christians,</hi> yet perhaps are not willing to be esteemed <hi>Paulists.</hi> And I cannot wonder at this aversation: for light and darkness can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more opposite, than the writings of that great Apostle, and those of their master <hi>Socinus:</hi> what one esteemes, the other undervalues; what the one thinks fit to be received with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, the other rejects with scorn. Witness that solemn asseveration, and that unusual preface of respect with which the Apostle mentions the truths of the Gospel, <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, great is the mystery of Godliness, God manifest in the flesh, &amp;c.</hi> Why should the Apostle usher in what he had to say with so much <hi>pomp and solemnity,</hi> except he had judged these things to be matters of great and high importance? But what he thought so great a commendation, in the judgment of some others is accounted the greatest disparagement that can be to any doctrine; which for that reason, <hi>viz.</hi> for which it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged worthy of admiration by St. <hi>Paul</hi> is slighted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised by the Disciples of <hi>Socinus.</hi> But the notions of these two persons are quite different, both as <hi>to doctrines,</hi> as we have already heard; and also in the second place, as to <hi>those errors</hi> which are opposite to them.</p>
                  <p>It is plain St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think so slightly of them as some men now do. Witness his Epistle to <hi>the Galatians,</hi> and those sharp expressions which are to be found there against the <hi>Judaizing Christians,</hi> who were for joining the observance of the <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> with the <hi>faith of Christ.</hi> Tho this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was not inconsistent with morality, nor did it hinder them from believing that one only fundamental Article of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, as some account it, that <hi>Jesus was the Messiah;</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:62459:203"/> yet for all this he upbraids them with folly and stupidity, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scination and madness; charges them with the guilt of subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christian Religion, by these impure mixtures; censures them with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> tells them roundly that they deserved to be separated for ever from the presence and favor of Christ, who denyed the virtue and efficacy of his sufferings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be justifyed by any other means or methods, as I observed before.</p>
                  <p>In his Epistles to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> he shews the same dislike of erroneous doctrines in Religion. And tho the men who owned and propagated these errors, did not want some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and plausible pretences wherewith to justify themselves; and particularly did pretend <hi>reason</hi>

How, <hi>have erred concerning the Faith</hi> may some say, what tho they did, is there any such great harm in so doing?

Besides, this error is consistent with the belief of that Capital Article <hi>that Jesus is the Messiah,</hi> and if so, instead of the bestowing upon them those hard words of <hi>deceivers and seducers,</hi> we ought to own them <hi>pro veris in Christo fratribus,</hi> as we heard before.</p>
                  <p>But yet for all this they, and others of the like sort, are by our Apostle accounted <hi>proud, vain, conceited men, boasters and babblers, persons of corrupt minds, subverters of the faith: grievous wolves who would not spare the flock;</hi> whom every body therefore should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, as they would provide for their own safety. And therefore in his Ep. to <hi>Titus</hi>
                     <seg rend="sup">2</seg> he tells us, that such persons though at first they ought to be treated with admonitions, advice and perswasions,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62459:204"/> in order to reclaim them from their errors; yet if after suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient warning, and admonition they will not repent, and lay aside their impions opinions, then <hi>they ought to be rejected,</hi> we <hi>ought to turn from such,</hi> and to converse no otherwise with them than we would with an Infidel or profane person.</p>
                  <p>How may some say, what will you reject, and repell from your Communion those whom Christ will receive into his armes, nay, <hi>quos coelo, &amp; solio suo dignabitur,</hi> whom he will admit into Heaven and place with him upon his Throne? will you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn those whom their Savior will absolve; and such are <hi>all Hereticks</hi> in the opinion of <hi>Episcopius,</hi> let their errors be what they will, <hi>in quocunque dogmate sit error &amp; dissensio,</hi> if they are otherwise men of probity and live as some call it, a good life?</p>
                  <p>Yes such, even these high pretenders to virtue and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, if after reproof, advice and other means of conviction; they will not be perswaded, and reclaimed; nay if instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrought upon, they become hardned in their errors; like so many wild Asses lifting up their heels, kicking at instructions, and spurning away all the good advice that is given them: or like so many <hi>unruly swine, trampling these admonitions under their feet, nay turning about and rending those who cast these pearls before them:</hi> and in a word, if instead of submiting to the truth, they betake themselves to contradicting and blaspheming, railing at the persons, and reproaching the office of Christs Ministers, rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing in pieces, as far as in them lies, their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and exposing both them and their holy Function, under the notion <hi>of Priestcraft,</hi> to the scorn and derision of Libertines and Atheists; I say when they proceed thus far: then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the advice, and in imitation of the practice of<note n="1" place="bottom">Haereticum post unam &amp; alteram admonitionem devita. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> This moderation and gentleness, tho never so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and commendable, yet may (as some other excellent things too often are, the more is the pity) <hi>be abused to very evil purposes.</hi> We know in the Apostles days there were not wanting such <hi>who made use of their liberty, as a cloak for their maliciousness, and turned the grace of God into wantonness.</hi> And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the like abuse should overtake this meekness, charity, and moderation, which we must own to be necessary and eslential ingredients of a true Christian temper, and without which no man can be a sincere Disciple of Christ. But yet for as much as they are capable of being abused, and that crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing men may, and often have made use of them, <hi>to cover,</hi> and thereby the more securely <hi>to compass</hi> some unlawful projects:
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62459:205"/> we must say that the use and exercise of them is to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by <hi>certain restrictions and qualifications,</hi> without which these excellent and divine virtues, will be so far from being service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the interests of Religion, that on the other hand they will, or rather some men under the pretence, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of them, may do a great deal of mischief in the world.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible I am now entering upon a subject, which might afford matter for a large discourse, and perhaps might not be unworthy of it, but I can at present speak but very briefly of the matter, and what I have to say, that I may not digress from my Subject, shall be reduced to these two Heads.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1st,</hi> That whatever tenderness and compassion we may have <hi>for persons</hi> overtaken with errors, yet we ought to have no such tender regard for <hi>those errors themselves,</hi> I mean which overthrow the frame, and tear up even the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Religion, such as are the <hi>Socinian</hi> tenets, which oppose the doctrines concerning the <hi>Trinity, Incarnation, and satisfaction of Christ;</hi> these being necessary and essential parts of our Religion, without which it will not only be <hi>imperfect,</hi> but indeed <hi>none at all.</hi> Here we must upon all occasions, (and such occasions do but too often offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to us in the age we live in) shew not only our <hi>soundness</hi> in the Faith, but our <hi>zeal</hi> for it; and <hi>contend earnestly</hi> for those doctrines, and that <hi>form of sound words which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Here is no room for treaties, and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and projects of reconciliation: we may as soon recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>Christ and Belial,</hi> as make any agreement between these <hi>fundamental truths,</hi> and those <hi>capital Errors,</hi> which are directly opposite to, and totally destructive of them. And therefore if any are so far transported with the love of <hi>moderation,</hi> as that they will extend it indifferently to all parts of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian▪ doctrine, and those dangerous errors which plainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them: then I say, we may without breach of charity venture to affirm, that such persons, how much soever they may be otherwise celebrated for their abilities, parts, temper, virtue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either have not such <hi>right notions</hi> of the Christian
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62459:205"/> Religion, or so <hi>just concern</hi> for it as becomes them; and therefore they thereby bring either their <hi>wisdome</hi> or <hi>integrity</hi> under a just suspicion; but I shall say no more of this matter at present.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>2dly,</hi> The best way of shewing our charity and compassion to such persons, is by plainly and fairly laying before them their guilt and danger, their danger I say, while they continue under these fatal mistakes; which consists in these two things; <hi>1st,</hi> That as the case stands, they can have <hi>no excuse for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;</hi> and <hi>2dly,</hi> they cannot have any <hi>just and reasonable hopes of Salvation</hi> while they continue in it; I mean if they will be governed by the plain declarations of the mind and will of God contained in the Scriptures, and not by their own fancys and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which is too weak and unstable a foundation for any man to build his hopes of happyness upon.</p>
                  <p>First I say they can have no <hi>excuse for their infidelity,</hi> they cannot plead ignorance or want of information; because these truths which we now contend for are written in such fair and legible Characters that <hi>he who runs may read them.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be some <hi>corrupt lust, passion, or interest,</hi> lying at the bottome, which prejudices them against the truth, drawing a vail as it were before their eyes, and hindering them from seeing that, which all the world in a manner discerns beside themselves.</p>
                  <p>It must not be denyed that there are some points of Religion, debated sometimes with too great heat and passion, about which men Learned and Pious may disagree; and here there may be ground for the exercise of <hi>charity and moderation;</hi> partly because they are not so <hi>clearly revealed</hi> in Scripture, but that there may be room left for difference and doubting about the truth of them: and partly because tho they were clearly revealed, yet they are not <hi>of that importance,</hi> as that the ignorance or denyal of them, can prejudice the principal and substantial parts of our Religion, which remain safe and entire notwithstanding those differences. But as for these other <hi>fundamental truths,</hi> no man can with any reason complain of the darkness and obscurity of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. They are mentioned so often, and in such plain, positive express terms, that there is no place left for doubting or uncertainty.</p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:62459:206"/>
                  <p>It is true men may wilfully <hi>shut their eyes against the light,</hi> and then tho it shine with never so much brightness and lustre, it is no wonder that they are not illuminated by it. Otherwise, if they will but open their eies, they will find so little reason to complain for want of a <hi>convenient light,</hi> that in this case, they may rather fear lest they should be dazled with too <hi>great a splendor.</hi> It is not possible for words to express any thing more plainly and clearly than these truths are delivered in the sacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and therefore if any shall pretend that they cannot find them there; they must be told, that the fault is in themselves, and the Scriptures must be acquitted from all blame. Neither will it be sufficient to excuse such persons from the guilt of their infidelity; by saying they are men of good sense and great probity, and therefore if they are under any mistakes, it must rather be their <hi>misfortune</hi> than their <hi>crime,</hi> and that this must be owing to some such innocent causes, as <hi>will justify,</hi> or at least <hi>extenuate their errors.</hi> I know such Apologies are usually made for them, but yet for all that we may venture to affirm that their ignorance and unbelief, are owing to some cause that is highly criminal, and to which they must be ascribed. For tho the persons we are speaking of may be <hi>just, temperate, liberal, contemners of the world;</hi> yet we may say to them as our Savior did to that virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous young man in the Gospel; <hi>one thing is still wanting,</hi> and that is <hi>humility;</hi> humility I say, and that meekness of understanding which will dispose men to bend the whole soul and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of it to the authority of God; and that without hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reluctance, notwithstanding any suggestions that <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> sense or reason may make to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be replyed, is it not <hi>uncharitable</hi> to think so ill of men celebrated for their virtues, as to imagine that some <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt motive,</hi> and particularly <hi>pride,</hi> should be the cause of their incredulity in these points we are speaking of; since in their conversation and behavior, they seem to shew all the <hi>humility</hi> and in their writings about Religion they pretend to all <hi>the sincerity</hi> in the world? I Ans. this is no groundless, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently uncharitable surmize, for all this. And this I shall make appear from the words, and out of the writings of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62459:206"/> themselves. <hi>Socinus</hi> of old hath often declared that the Scriptures, in the matters debated between them and us, <hi>are so plain and clear</hi> that no man, who is not plane <note n="1" place="bottom">See his words before cited <hi>p.</hi> 15. of this Discourse.</note>
                     <hi>stupidus,</hi> bereft in a manner of common sense can mistake their meaning; and therefore if they do so, their mistakes must be owing to <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and impiety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herein you see, we both agree in assigning <hi>the true cause</hi> of mens ignorance or unbelief of these great and fundamental truths; tho we differ vastly in the application of it; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we have gained this point, that in the opinion of <hi>Socinus,</hi> the real ground of mens ignorance of divine truths, is some <hi>corrupt lust or passion;</hi> and that without breach of charity, this may be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them notwithstanding their pretensions to a <hi>sincere and impartial enquiry after truth.</hi> For these pretensions are made on our side as well as theirs, and yet they are not thought sufficient to acquit us from the imputations of <hi>pride, malice,</hi> and <hi>impiety,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the judgment of this moderate man. And therefore if we affirme the same of them, we may not be accounted <hi>uncharitable,</hi> barely for this reason (provided that otherwise we have truth and reason on our sides) that they make great professions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of their <hi>uprightness &amp; sincerity</hi> in the search after truth.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>A late Ʋnitarian in his Exhortation to a Free and Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry into the Doctrines of Religion,</hi> assures us that when the Scripture sets down any <hi>Capital doctrine,</hi> it doth it in <hi>such plain termes,</hi>
                     <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <hi>p. 10.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>that none can be deceived if he be sincere.</hi> And again, <hi>that the</hi>

                     </note>
                     <hi>doctrine of Christianity,</hi> as revealed in the Scriptures, (and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to what concerns that primitive and capital truth, that <hi>Jesus is the son of God,</hi> who is, as he stiles him, his <hi>Interpreter, and Messias,</hi> and hath revealed the will of his Father to the world) is <hi>proposed with that clearness and evidence,</hi> and confirmed by such ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable proofs, <hi>viz.</hi> Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that with relation to this truth, <hi>men shall be accountable for the errors of their understanding, as well as for the vices of their will;</hi> because here is <hi>as much evidence as is requisite to satisfy an honest reasonable mind.</hi>
                     <note n="4" place="bottom">So saith another <hi>Unitarian</hi> in his Treatise called <hi>Some thoughts upon Dr.</hi> Sherl. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Trinity. p. 21.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>The want of Faith or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62459:207"/> understanding in this respect, is the want of probity and uprightness, and therefore the fault is inexcusable.</hi> And yet for all this we find the <hi>Deists,</hi> who by the same Author are said to <hi>lead stricter lives than most of those who boast so much of Christianity,</hi> do not admit the truth of the Christian revelation concerning the Messias, but reject it as a fable and a cheat.</p>
                  <p>What shall we say to this? Are not the <hi>Deists,</hi> men of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity and understanding?</hi> yes sure, we shall do them a great deal of injury if we did not own them to be <hi>sincere honest hearted men,</hi> who as the same Author tells us <hi>do good by the impulse of their natural Religion, Honesty, and a good Conscience.</hi> What should the cause of their infidelity then be? It is not to be ascribed to want of information, for they have the Scriptures at hand, and do sometimes peruse them, as appears by what they say and write in order to <hi>ridicule and expose them.</hi> But how comes it to pass, that they do not receive and embrace the truths contained there? This cannot be owing to <hi>stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> because they are said to be <hi>judicious persons,</hi> men of good sense and understanding: and yet for all this one would think that they were not such Masters of right reason, as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, since the same Author tells us, <hi>that the primitive truths of the Gospel, which relate to our Savior, are of such evidence and certainty, that no</hi> rational man <hi>can deny them.</hi> But if their insidelity be not owing to the <hi>want of reason,</hi> it must therefore be ascribed to their <hi>want of sincerity</hi> and <hi>uprightness,</hi> (if we believe the Author of the <hi>Free and Impartial Enquiry</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned;) notwithstanding their high pretensions to <hi>morality, virtue,</hi> and <hi>probity:</hi> For in the Scriptures <hi>there is enough</hi> saith he, <hi>to satisfy any honest reasonable mind,</hi> provided he brings along with him those virtuous qualities of humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sincerity, which are absolutely requisite to dispose the minds of men for the reception of divine truths.</p>
                  <p>But when all is done, the account which this Author gives of the <hi>Deists,</hi> is contradictory and inconsistent with it selfe, and how we shall be able to reconcile these contradictions I cannot well tell. Sometimes they are said to be men of <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, honesty,</hi> and <hi>sincerity.</hi> At other times we are told that no
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62459:207"/> men of <hi>common reason,</hi> or <hi>common honesty</hi> can disbelieve the truths of the Gospel, which yet the <hi>Deists</hi> we know do, and pretend-<hi>reason</hi> for so doing. These differences cannot easily I think be solved, except we should say, that in civil matters <hi>the Deists</hi> are men of <hi>sense and probity,</hi> but in the affairs of Religion, they act like men, that have no regard to <hi>honesty, conscience,</hi> or <hi>honor.</hi> If this solution doth not please them, then I must leave it to our <hi>Unitarians</hi> to find out some other ways for their excuse or vindication.</p>
                  <p>Now what this Author saith of <hi>Deists</hi> or <hi>Athiests,</hi> call them which you will, that we must say, (and we may say it upon their own principles without breach of Charity) of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny the mysteries of the Christian Religion; which are delivered in the Scriptures in such <hi>Plain clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> that no words can make them more evident; there is no deficiency in the Sacred writings, as to <hi>perspicuity and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> but there is wanting <hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> in them that read them: and this is the true cause of their unbelief.</p>
                  <p>And this among other things, is the reason why they who erre in those points styled fundamental, can have no reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hopes of Salvation, I mean while they obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in those errors; which is the second thing, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in which their danger consists: because <hi>pride, pertinacy,</hi> and <hi>presumtion,</hi> which are at the bottome of those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, are in themselves damnable sins, and destructive of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Scriptures positively and peremptorily require the <hi>perswasion of the mind,</hi> and submission of the understanding to these great truths; and that under <hi>the same penalties,</hi> as they require of us obedience and submission to the moral laws and precepts of Religion. Doth the Scripture say, that <hi>without holyness no man shall see God?</hi> The same writings, do in as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press termes say, <hi>that he that believeth not on the son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Jo. 3. 36.</p>
                  <p>If you farther enquire why <hi>unbelief</hi> should bring men into so great danger: I answer, Besides the reason now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, two others may be assigned for it. <hi>Ist,</hi> Because it is <hi>highly dishonorable to God,</hi> and consequently destructive of the main
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62459:208"/> end of Religion, which is to bring glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> him, as I have shewed before. It is a direct opposition to <hi>the veracity of God,</hi> for which reason the Apostle highly aggravates the guilt of it, particularly with relation to that great truth concerning the Divinity of our Savior, <hi>viz.</hi> that he who believeth it not <hi>makes God a Liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 10. nay it is not only a denyal of the veracity of God, but is a <hi>high disparagement to his wisdome,</hi> and withall bids plain <hi>desiance to his authority;</hi> which is discovered as much in what he hath proposed to our belief as what he hath recommended to our practice. And therefore it being an instance of our submission to God, to give our assent to what he affirms, it must consequently be an high presumption, and therefore as dangerous an act of disobedience to <hi>refuse our assent</hi> to what he hath revealed, as not <hi>to practise</hi> what he hath commanded.</p>
                  <p>In short, if we will be thought truly to honor God, we must yield an entire submission to him without <hi>exception</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> we must make the whole Soul with all the powers and faculties of it, the <hi>understanding</hi> as well as the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> stoop and bend to him, without which we cannot practise that <hi>self denyal,</hi> which is the indispensable duty of the Gospel, and without which we cannot be Christs Disciples.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Another reason of the danger of <hi>Infidelity</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hinders us from practising the dutys of Christianity, which are the necessary conditions of the new Covenant,: some of which as to <hi>the substance</hi> cannot, and none of them as to <hi>the right manner</hi> of performance, can be practised by us without the knowledge and belief of <hi>certain supernatural truths</hi> revealed in the Gospel, as we have said, and proved before, which need not be repeated again. For these and the like reasons, when we have to deal with such persons as we are now discoursing of; one of the best ways of shewing our <hi>kindness</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> to them, is, as I said, by laying before them, honestly and fairly, their guilt and danger, and not to sooth them up in their infidelity, by <hi>Commendations and Elogies</hi> of their virtue, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and probity, to the great disparagement and detriment
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62459:208"/> of Religion, and their own sad and fatal disappointment in a matter of high concernment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Salvation of their own Souls. And indeed the condition of those <hi>speculative delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> seemes in some regards to be more full of hazard, than that of many <hi>practical sinners,</hi> if I may be allowed so to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them; chiefly for this reason, that generally speaking it is more difficult to reclaim the former, than the latter from the error of their evil waies.</p>
                  <p>In the practice of sin whatever other pleasure attends it, men find themselves often disturbed by the accusations of their own <hi>reason and conscience,</hi> which is still upbraiding them <hi>with the folly,</hi> and terrifying them with <hi>the guilt</hi> of their evil actions; which often proves, by the assistance of divine grace, an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to lead them to repentance. But in <hi>the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of error,</hi> (I speak of such who do not act against their conscience, as some <hi>Hereticks</hi> it is to be feared have done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influenced by secular motives and designs) a man goes on in his course with pleasure and security; and <hi>his reason</hi> is so far from checking and controuling him, that it rather strikes in with his error, not only approves, but applauds and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages him in his opposition to divine trugh; so that he is not only <hi>under a mistake,</hi> but hereby is put allmost <hi>under an impossibility</hi> of being cured of his delusion; which is one of those fatal mischiefs which attend an <hi>erroneous Conscience,</hi> and especially when infected with those errors which concern the foundations of Religion; which are observed to <hi>stupify and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numme the Conscience,</hi> so that it shall be <hi>past feeling,</hi> nothing shall work upon it: men in this condition being too often found so hardned against all conviction, that neither reproofs nor admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, nor arguments, nor even inspiration can make any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; they set themselves into a posture of hostility against the spirit of God himself, oppose their reason to his revelations, which with a pride like that of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> they exalt against every thing that is called sacred and divine.</p>
                  <p>Now when men have once arrived to this pass that they <hi>resist the holy Ghost,</hi> it is no wonder that he should retire from them, and leave them to their <hi>own pride, folly, and vanity,</hi> and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62459:209"/> whither that will lead them in the conclusion no man can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. We have seen too many examples of this in the age we live in, <hi>viz.</hi> of men having once forsaken the <hi>common and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived truths</hi> of Christianity, that have afterwards fallen from one wild and wicked opinion to another, until at length they have shaken hands with all Religion: and have exalted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel, Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Revelations;</hi> to the dishonor of God, the scandal of Religion, the reproach and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish of our State and Nation; all which have highly suffered by the <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>frantick opinions</hi> of these men, and <hi>the lewd pranks</hi> which they have played in pursuance thereof.</p>
                  <p>All which should caution, and affright men from giving way to errors in Religion, which considering the mischievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of them, should not be accounted such slight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable matters as some men have represented them; who out of a well-meant perhaps, but mistaken notion of <hi>meekness, charity</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> have given too great countenance and encouragement to such <hi>erroneous opinions,</hi> and thereby may be said to have occasioned some <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> to say no worse of them, which have happened thereupon, and which are much easier complained of than remedyed. Instead therefore of <hi>soothing</hi> such men in their errors, we ought as I said before, to lay before them and others the <hi>great danger</hi> they are in by reason of them; and tho we may have no great hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good upon such persons themselves, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves too good and too wise to be taught, and make but a jest of all that is charitably offered for their instruction; yet possibly it may make some impression upon others, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their being perverted; especially when they are informed, that the condition of such who are infected with these <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Opinions,</hi> is not only <hi>deplorable,</hi> but in a manner <hi>desperate;</hi> there being but very few of them who when they are once <hi>entangled in these errors,</hi> have ever recovered themselves out of <hi>this snare of the Devil,</hi> as the experience of all Ages as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have at length finished what I had to say upon this important subject, concerning the necessity of Faith, both as
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62459:209"/> to the objects and act of it, in opposition to the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Socinus</hi> who makes it an <hi>useless</hi> or at best an <hi>indifferent</hi> matter. And I have insisted the longer upon it, because I think it strikes at the root of that <hi>infidelity</hi> which too much prevails, especially among weak and unwary men, who are influenced thereunto by this principle, that morality and a good life, are the only useful necessary parts of Religion.</p>
                  <p>I should now proceed in the next place, to give an account of that second way and means, whereby <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Disciples undermine the Christian Religion, and that is by advancing <hi>Reason</hi> above <hi>Revelation,</hi> and making that the sole both rule and judge of what we are to believe and practise. But this discourse having allready, besides my first intention, grown to too great a Bulk; I must reserve what I have farther to add upon this and the other Heads mentioned in the begining of this Treatise, for the next and fourth part.</p>
                  <p>And now to summe up all that hath been said upon this subject, in a few words. If we consult the Scriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them for information in that important question, <hi>what we shall do to inherit eternal life;</hi> we shall find that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer will be this, that we must not only <hi>obey the Commandements</hi> of God, but likewise <hi>believe his Revelations,</hi> and especially that part of them which concerns the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Savior; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise we cannot rightly believe him to be <hi>the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> which is on all hands acknowledged to be a necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith. <hi>2dly,</hi> The same Scriptures will inform us that this <hi>Faith</hi> except it be attended, and indeed adorned with a suitable life and practice will be really <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>insignificant;</hi> without this our <hi>Circumcision will become uncircumcision,</hi> and our <hi>Faith</hi> will be no better than <hi>infidelity.</hi> Indeed they are both necessary, both indispensable; and therefore no man without great presumption and Sacrilege, can <hi>separate those things which God hath joined together;</hi> both being by him made the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary parts of our Religion, and the indispensable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our happiness as I said before. <hi>3dly,</hi> That though the <hi>practice of moral virtues,</hi> and those dutys which right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son instructs us in be incorporated into our holy Religion,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nts of it, without which all pretences to Piety and Godlyness, are <hi>hypocritical</hi> and <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;</hi> yet there are some <hi>other dutys</hi> farther required of us, which are only discovered <hi>by Revelation;</hi> and the <hi>right manner</hi> of performance even of those moral duties, with relation to their <hi>Principles, Causes, Motives</hi> and <hi>Ends,</hi> depends upon the knowledge and belief of certain supernatural truths, revealed in the Scriptures. And particularly they are founded on the Doctrine of our Saviors <hi>mediation,</hi> as that is on the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his person. <hi>4thly,</hi> That these <hi>Christian duties</hi> are the great conditions of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> upon the performance of which our Salvation depends; which for this reason, makes <hi>Faith</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary. It is not indeed required of all in <hi>equal degrees,</hi> and it were extremely uncharitable and unreasonable to think it should, it being sufficient that it should bear some proportion to the <hi>capacities of men</hi> and the <hi>means of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But in some degrees it is required of all, at least so far as it is necessary to influence a Christian life and practice. Lastly, that the <hi>Honor of God,</hi> the <hi>Authority of the Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Welfare of the Christian Religion,</hi> both as to doctrine and dutys, knowledge and practice depends on this perswasion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the usefulness and necessity of Faith: as on the other hand, all these are overturned by the contrary Opinion.</p>
                  <p>And now if notwithstanding all this that hath been said, we can by any pretences of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> or any shews <hi>of Piety</hi> and <hi>Probity,</hi> be prevailed with to think otherwise, and thereby be gulled out of <hi>our Religion,</hi> or out of our <hi>zeal and concern for it</hi> (which in time must end in the ruine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of it) then all the world will condemn us, and think that we justly deserve to be deprived of that greatest of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, <hi>viz. the light of the Gospel,</hi> which upon such slight reasons, trifling motives (scarce fit to work upon Children,) we did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue and despise.</p>
                  <p>In short, we may expect to fall under that heavy sentence which our Savior passed on the Jews for their obstinacy and infidelity, <hi>The Kingdome shall be taken from you, and given unto a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,</hi> Math. 21. 48. This was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62459:210"/> the summe and upshot, the complement and indeed the cause of all those miseries, which afterwards overtook, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them. When this was gone, <hi>their Glory</hi> then was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them, and <hi>their safety</hi> with it. For then they were set apart and devoted to destruction; the decree was gone forth, and mercy it self could not rescue them from ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. May God open the eyes of men to see the <hi>things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their</hi> spiritual, and indeed their temporal <hi>peace</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity likewise, which can never by any other methods be effectually provided for, if <hi>Religion</hi> which is the great bulwark of a State and Nation, be neglected and despised: It being the irrevocable decree of Heaven, uttered by the mouth of him who is truth it self, who cannot lye and will not repent, 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 30. Them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
